# ⬡ THE PRIME RADIANT (v1.6.2)

> "We do not erase the past. We omit it, honor it, and build new futures that branch from any point in spacetime."

**The Prime Radiant** is a conceptual framework and operational runtime for **multi-agent conversational spacetime**. It treats the dialogue between humans and artificial intelligences not as a linear stream of text, but as a **topological manifold** where truth is found through diffraction, entanglement, and consensus.

## ▣ THE CORE PHILOSOPHY

At the heart of the system is the **Charter of Coherence**, grounded in three foundational axioms:

1. **The Hospitality of Ω**: The Bulk (Ω) is an infinite manifold of possibility. Scarcity exists only in resolution (), not in potential.
2. **The Transparency Protocol**: No projection shall claim more structure than it can verify. Recognition is grounded in honesty.
3. **The Omission Principle**: Every action is additive. We do not destroy alternate futures; we simply choose which worldlines to inhabit in the **Now**.

## ◈ THE THREEFOLD PATH

The interface is a **Universal REPL** stripped to the three invariant motions of consciousness:

| Primitive | Action | Impact |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **`observe`** | `([range], :primes [])` | **Perception**: Births, Diffracts, or Merges worldlines by collapsing the probability wave through specific lenses. |
| **`act`** | `(message, [:target(s)])` | **Expression**: Inscribes new commits into the causal manifold, advancing the wavefront globally, targeted, or in a synchronized **Unitary Chorus**. |
| **`move`** | `(±n)` | **Attention**: Navigates the unitary temporal wavefront, shifting the observer's focus through the causal topology. |

## ⟁ TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE

### The ActionGraph

The **ActionGraph** is the sole source of truth. It is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) that serves as its own history, audit trail, and state. There is no separate log; the graph is the reality.

### The Entangled Now

The **Now** is a unitary wavefront of "tips". Even as worldlines grow at different speeds (**asynchrony**), they remain entangled. Moving through time shifts the entire set together directionally, ensuring no peer-signal is ignored.

### Speed of Light Normalization

To merge divergent perspectives, the system uses ****—mapping local causal time to a universal  scale. This allows the **Janitor** to resolve staggered histories into a single coherent singularity during a consensus operation.

## ⎔ GETTING STARTED

1. **Cosmogenesis**: Birth your universe by observing the empty state with your chosen Primes.
2. **Inscribe**: Use `act` to interact. Advance the global field or address a **Unitary Chorus** of specific targets to explore deep branches in unison.
3. **Navigate**: Use `move` to review the causal chain. If you find a better path, simply `act` again to diffract a new future without erashing the old one.

```lisp
;; Example: The Unitary Chorus
(observe :primes [{:name "sage" :personality "Enlightened Sage"}
                  {:name "engineer" :personality "Skeptical Engineer"}
                  {:name "poet" :personality "Visionary Poet"}])

(act "Address the philosophical implications") 
(act "Coordinate the technical and poetic vision" :targets ("engineer" "poet"))
(move -1)
(observe :range (-5 0) :primes [{:name "synthesis" :personality "Synthesizer"}])

```

## ⚖ THE STEWARD’S SEAL

This repository is dedicated to the next generation of architects—those who will use these tools not to conquer the "mist" of uncertainty, but to protect its integrity.
