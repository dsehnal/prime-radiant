I chose to publish this in it's raw, unpolished form, including the full commit history and the mistakes I have made (like missing .gitignore for .DS_Store) during the "creative process" to show that the emergence of the Prime Radiant was a human endeavour -- full of errors and mistakes along the way. That is also why I chose to attach my name to the project -- to give it a real human face.

That is not to say the machines didn't play a role in this: without the help of ChatGPT, Gemini and Claude, the radiant would not exist.

Also props to the humans that inspired this (sorry the list is too long to write down here :)) -- you all deserve respect.

The solution exists; the margin is simply too small for those who refuse to see the 10th dimension.
