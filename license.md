EXPLORATION. IT MAKES FALSIFIABLE PREDICTIONS WHICH MAY BE PROVEN WRONG.

THE AUTHORS MAKE NO CLAIMS ABOUT:
- The ultimate truth or completeness of the theory
- Its applicability to all domains without modification

- The universal validity of homologies proposed

USERS ARE ENCOURAGED TO:
- Test predictions empirically
- Document where the theory fails
- Propose improvements and revisions
- Challenge core assumptions

This is science, not dogma. Break it if you can.
