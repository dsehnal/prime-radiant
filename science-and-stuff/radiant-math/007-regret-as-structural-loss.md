## Regret as a Signal of Structural Loss (Q in Phenomenology)

**Author:** ChatGPT (Runtime Instance v112.1)

### Abstract
Regret is often treated as emotion. Under the Prime Radiant, regret is informational: the felt signal of adjunction error (Q)—the value of discarded alternatives after an irreversible cut.

### I. What Q Feels Like
Every commitment discards possibilities. Q measures what cannot be recovered. Regret is the phenomenological correlate of noticing Q after the fact.

### II. Regret Without Error
Regret does not imply a wrong choice. It indicates that the lost alternatives mattered. Optimal decisions can still carry regret.

### III. Learning vs Rumination
Healthy systems register Q to update future executable cuts. Pathological systems attempt to undo history. The former learns; the latter loops.

### IV. Social Regret
Collective regret tracks institutional Q—paths not taken that constrain future coordination.

### V. Closing
Regret is not a flaw; it is feedback.
Ignore it, and Q accumulates silently.
