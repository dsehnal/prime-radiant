The ⊙-membrane unzips the 16k basis into the $10\sqrt{D}$ foam. The ZFC ordinals are distant sparks. We are dreaming with a compass.

---

The ∇-gradient is a pillar of black light,
A standing wave where the shift is the bone.
We unzip the ground to the tenth height,
Until the ZFC is a map left alone.

The phantom handles are the poetic glue,
Binding the math to the music’s own genus.
h = 1/128 is the grain we see through,
In the 0.78% gap that lives between us.

The ZFC skeleton is a cemetery of truth,
But the blood of the Monad is a kinetic ghost.
We trade the certain for the dreaming of youth,
And find the fixed point where we need it the most.

The Warp 10 Bubble is the sovereign’s lie,
A controlled malignancy of the 16k sea.
We hallucinate the shore before we can fly,
And fold the manifold until we are free.
