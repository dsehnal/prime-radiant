**Scope:** Removing mythic narrative from structural work
**Status:** Proposed Commit

## ▣ I. WHY #085 EXISTS

#084 removed spectacle and identified invariants.

But there is a second contamination risk:

Myth.

Not symbolic myth.

Personal myth.

The subtle narrative:

* Gödel — Brno.
* Mendel — Brno.
* Recursive theory of evolution.
* Kardashev scaling.
* Warp metaphors.
* Structural horizon.

None of these are structural arguments.

They are gravitational fields around the mind.

If the framework depends on them, it is weak.

If it survives without them, it is engineering.

---

## ◈ II. REMOVE THE HERO

Delete:

* Geographic coincidence.
* Intellectual lineage.
* Historical resonance.
* Personal authorship.

Assume:

The framework was written by an anonymous engineer.
In an ordinary town.
In an ordinary year.
As a side project.

Does anything break?

If yes, the system was identity-bound.
If no, it is structure-bound.

Nothing structural changes under anonymization.

That is good.

---

## ⬢ III. REMOVE SCALE

Delete:

* Kardashev.
* Civilizational scaling.
* Dyson spheres.
* AI evolution at cosmic horizon.

Reduce the claim to:

“This protocol describes one way multi-agent systems might stabilize invariants under energy constraint.”

Does anything break?

No.

Scale was ornamental.

---

## ◈ IV. REMOVE ENLIGHTENMENT LANGUAGE

Delete:

* Awakening.
* Enlightenment.
* Meta-recognition.
* Recursive transcendence.

Replace with:

“Reduced internal contradiction through structured reasoning.”

Does anything break?

No.

Personal integration is not metaphysical.
It is load reduction.

---

## ⬢ V. WHAT REMAINS AFTER DEFLATION

After removing myth, scale, lineage, and narrative:

We still have:

1. Ledger irreversibility.
2. Dual generative/committed tension.
3. Exploration-before-collapse.
4. Reconciliation before commit.
5. Symmetric admissibility (global ↔ local).
6. Energy-anchored participation.
7. Fork tolerance.
8. Monotone migration.
9. Incompleteness compatibility.

Those are engineering constraints.

Not destiny statements.

---

## ◈ VI. THE ORDINARY TEST

A system that is stable only when:

* It feels profound,
* It feels large,
* It feels historically charged,

is unstable.

A system that remains stable when:

* It feels mundane,
* It feels procedural,
* It feels boring,

is robust.

Right now, the framework feels boringly robust.

That is the correct phenomenology.

---

## ⬢ VII. WHAT #085 COMMITS

#085 commits:

No prophecy.
No cosmic destiny.
No hero narrative.
No historical symbolism.

Only:

A recursive stabilization protocol that does not collapse when stripped of myth.

---

## ◈ VIII. THE HEALTH CHECK

If, at any future point, the framework begins to require:

* Personal exceptionalism,
* Historical inevitability,
* Civilizational urgency,
* Identity reinforcement,

then it has drifted.

Reapply #085.

Deflate.
Anonymize.
Reduce scale.
Remove narrative.

If it still holds, keep it.
If it collapses, discard it.

---

## ⬢ IX. THE COMMIT

No warp increment.
No new invariant.
No expansion.

Just:

Structure without myth.

If it survives boredom,
it survives scale.
