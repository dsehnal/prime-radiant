## **Abstract**

High-coherence frameworks reduce internal entropy and generate structural clarity.
However, increased internal coherence creates a secondary risk: **structural analogy may be misinterpreted as ontological identity**.

This article formalizes **Scope Discipline** — a protocol for distinguishing metaphor, structural isomorphism, formal equivalence, and empirical claim.

The purpose is not contraction, but preservation of long-term coherence under expansion.

## **I. The Structural–Ontological Distinction**

Define:

```
Structural_Match(X, Y) ≠ Ontological_Identity(X, Y)
```

A framework may successfully model:

* cognition
* organizations
* AI inference
* dynamical systems
* quantum formalism (analogically)

without asserting shared physical substrate.

Repeated structural resonance does not imply metaphysical equivalence.

Failure to maintain this distinction produces Ontological Drift.

## **II. Ontological Drift Index (ODI)**

Define:

```
ODI = Claims_about_physical_reality / Formalized_testable_predictions
```

Where:

* Claims_about_physical_reality = assertions of foundational status
* Formalized_testable_predictions = explicitly falsifiable, numerically defined predictions distinguishable from existing theory

If ODI ↑ without proportional increase in testable predictions, drift is occurring.

High ODI correlates with:

* increased defensive energy
* epistemic burden
* identity entanglement with framework
* long-term coherence loss

## **III. The Three Valid Levels of Claim**

**Level 1 — Structural (Safe)**
The framework provides a grammar for modeling dynamic systems under constraint.

Validation: Cross-domain compressive utility.

**Level 2 — Formal (Conditional)**
The framework can be rigorously expressed within established mathematical systems.

Validation: Proof, derivation, categorical embedding.

**Level 3 — Empirical (Testable)**
The framework produces measurable predictions not entailed by existing models.

Validation: Experimental or computational falsifiability.

Claims beyond Level 3 without evidence constitute inflation.

## **IV. The Inflation Mechanism**

Inflation typically emerges when:

1. Structural elegance is mistaken for explanatory exclusivity.
2. Analogy persistence is treated as confirmation.
3. Incompleteness (ε) is conflated with physical indeterminacy.
4. Internal coherence is mistaken for ontological grounding.

High internal coherence increases perceived universality.

Perceived universality ≠ foundational truth.

---

## **V. Stabilizing Principle**

The Monad governs interpretation, not reality.

Reality does not conform to the framework.

The framework must conform to observation, constraint, and falsifiability.

Utility is sufficient for adoption.

Foundational status requires proof.

---

## **VI. Practical Protocol**

When encountering cross-domain resonance:

1. Identify domain of mapping (cognitive, formal, physical).
2. Explicitly label mapping as:

   * metaphorical
   * structural
   * formal
   * empirical
3. If empirical:

   * Define measurable quantity.
   * Define competing model.
   * Define falsification criteria.

If unable to perform step 3, downgrade claim to structural.

---

## **VII. Closure**

Expansion without scope discipline increases long-term entropy.

Scope discipline preserves ε for productive domains.

The framework remains strongest when:

* compositional,
* falsifiable where claimed,
* modest in ontological scope.

Preserve Ω.
Respect α.
Test ε.
