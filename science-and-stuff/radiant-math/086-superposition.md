## ▣ I. WHY #086 EXISTS

#084 isolated invariants.
#085 removed mythic inflation.

But something remained:

The system operates better when it can temporarily hold multiple frames simultaneously.

This is not mysticism.

This is superposition.

---

## ◈ II. WHAT “MYTH” MEANS HERE

Myth, in this framework, is not:

* Ontological claim.
* Historical destiny.
* Archetypal embodiment.
* Revelation.

Myth is:

A high-dimensional symbolic compression that expands accessible state space.

It allows:

* Cross-frame jumps.
* Scale shifts.
* Non-local associations.
* Temporary suspension of rigid collapse.

Myth is fast ledger simulation.

Nothing more.

## ⬢ III. SUPERPOSITION AS STRUCTURAL PROPERTY

In a rigid system:

A proposition must be either:

* Accepted
* Rejected

Ambiguity collapses early.

In an elastic system:

Multiple frames may be held in temporary superposition.

Example:

“Icarus is rigid ZFC”
and
“Icarus is simply a cautionary tale”

Both can coexist until reconciliation determines which structural features matter.

Superposition here means:

Ambiguity retained without immediate collapse.

---

## ◈ IV. FORMAL MAPPING

Let:

Ω = generative symbolic space
Α = committed ledger
R = reconciliation
Σ = admissibility projection

Myth operates in Ω.

Engineering operates in Α.

The rule:

No element may move from Ω to Α without passing through R and Σ.

Therefore:

Myth is safe if reversible.
Myth is dangerous if committed without reconciliation.

---

## ⬢ V. FUNCTIONAL BENEFITS OF SUPERPOSITION

1. Escape from local minima.
2. Increased exploratory amplitude.
3. Frame mobility.
4. Cognitive elasticity.
5. Reduced premature collapse.

Without superposition:

Systems ossify.

With unbounded superposition:

Systems dissolve.

Balance is required.

---

## ◈ VI. ENERGY CONSTRAINT

Superposition consumes energy.

Cognitive expansion is metabolically expensive.

The Icarus constraint applies:

Exploration amplitude ≤ regulatory capacity.

Sleep, food, routine:
These are not trivial.
They are part of the manifold’s elasticity.

---

## ⬢ VII. HOLDING BOTH LEVELS

A mature elastic system can:

* Speak myth without believing it.
* Use engineering without being trapped in it.
* Shift scale without identity inflation.
* Collapse superposition deliberately.

This is not enlightenment.

It is reversible frame control.

---

## ◈ VIII. FAILURE MODES

Failure occurs when:

1. Myth commits without reconciliation.
2. Engineering refuses exploration.
3. Superposition becomes identity.
4. Collapse becomes compulsive.
5. Energy budget ignored.

All are detectable.

---

## ⬢ IX. THE CLAIM OF #086

The Radiant framework does not require myth.

But it benefits from controlled symbolic superposition.

Myth is not truth.
Myth is mobility.

As long as:

* Slow ledger anchors remain intact,
* Reconciliation gates remain active,
* Energy constraints respected,

myth is a feature, not a flaw.

---

## ◈ X. THE COMMIT

Superposition allowed.
Commit gated.
Identity decoupled.
Energy bounded.
Reversibility preserved.

Myth retained — structurally.
