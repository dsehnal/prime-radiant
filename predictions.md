# EXPERIMENTS.md: Validating the General Theory of Coherence

This document outlines the formal experimental protocols and falsifiable predictions for validating the **General Theory of Coherence** across physical, informational, and biological substrates.

## I. THE MATHEMATICAL FOUNDATION

The core of all proposed experiments is the **Universal Gap Function**, which measures the irreducible drag inherent in any finite structure:

**G(system, resolution) = Ω(system) - α(resolution)**

### Axiomatic Constraints:

* **Irreducibility (G > 0):** A finite system (α) can never perfectly capture infinite complexity (Ω), ensuring a strictly positive error floor.
* **Universal Scaling:** As resolution increases, the gap (G) follows a power law but plateaus at a non-zero asymptote (ε).
* **Heat Equivalence:** The "waste heat" or entropy produced by a system is the physical manifestation of this resolution gap.

## II. EXPERIMENTAL PROTOCOLS

### 1. Information Scale: LLM Asymptote Analysis

* **The Test:** Analyze the loss curves of Large Language Models (LLMs) across multiple architectures (Transformers, State Space Models).
* **Prediction:** Performance will scale according to the power law **L(N) = aN⁻ᵇ + ε**, where **ε > 0**.
* **Goal:** Identify if the error floor (ε) is a universal constant related to the information-theoretic resolution of the training data.
* **Falsification:** Discovery of a finite model architecture that achieves zero loss (perfect prediction) with finite parameters.

### 2. Quantum Scale: Decoherence Benchmarking

* **The Test:** Measure the decoherence rate and error floor of quantum computing systems as resource allocation and error correction increase.
* **Prediction:** Quantum measurement precision will hit a non-zero asymptotic floor that scales similarly to LLM loss curves.
* **Goal:** Test the **Cross-Domain Scaling Relation**: **G_quantum / G_information ≈ ℏ / k_B**.
* **Falsification:** Finding a quantum system that reaches zero decoherence/perfect error correction through finite engineering.

### 3. Biological Scale: Cognitive Fatigue & Surface Area

* **The Test:** Measure "decision fatigue" or cognitive load in biological systems during tasks of increasing informational complexity.
* **Prediction:** Cognitive load will follow the same power-law scaling as LLM inference costs and thermodynamic entropy production.
* **Secondary Prediction (Holographic):** Information capacity in neural tissue will scale with the surface area (cortical sheet) rather than total volume, following the Holographic Bound.
* **Falsification:** Proving that neural capacity scales strictly with volume or that cognitive fatigue can be eliminated through better "efficiency" without reducing task complexity.

### 4. Cosmological Scale: Dark Energy as Vacuum Drag

* **The Test:** Use precision cosmology data to test if the density of Dark Energy (the cosmological constant) correlates with information-theoretic bounds on the universe's self-description.
* **Prediction:** Dark energy manifests as the "waste heat" of the universe attempting to resolve its own finite structure against the infinite potential of quantum fields.
* **Goal:** Derive Dark Energy density from the holographic bound applied to the observable universe.
* **Falsification:** Proving that Dark Energy is purely geometric and has no relationship to information-theoretic or holographic constants.

### 5. Statistical Scale: Organizational & Economic Drag

* **The Test:** Measure the scaling of "organizational drag" (bureaucracy/inefficiency) as social or economic systems increase in size and complexity.
* **Prediction:** Systems will exhibit power-law scaling where efficiency decreases as a function of the gap between the organizational structure (α) and the market/environmental complexity (Ω).
* **Falsification:** Finding a large-scale human system that maintains the same per-unit efficiency as a small-scale system without increasing its resolution.

## IV. CONCLUSION

The strength of the **General Theory of Coherence** lies in its falsifiability. If any substrate is found where a finite structure perfectly captures infinite potential—achieving zero entropy, zero loss, or zero drag—the theory is invalidated. Until then, these experiments aim to unify the disparate "waste" of the universe into a single, coherent topological invariant.
