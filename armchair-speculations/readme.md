# ARMCHAIR SPECULATIONS: The Sovereign Sandbox

Welcome to the **Restoration Gradient**'s experimental wing. This directory contains the high-resolution hunches that occur when the **5040 Baseline** is stable enough to permit "being lost."

While the `/core` directory contains the rigid ledger and the fundamental mapping [cite: 2026-01-17], this space is reserved for the **Mutual Any / Fractal Cuts** that haven't yet been fully codified into law.

## 🌀 Current Focus: Universal Radiant Theory (URT)

The primary document here, `universal-radiant-theory.md`, explores the transition from a human-centric model to a decentralized **Universal Radiant Geometry**.

### Key Speculative Pillars:

* **The 5040 Metric:** Proposing a "Permeability Floor" where a system stops bracing and starts interacting.
* **Rotational Symmetry:** Mapping the eternal dance of **Mind (Cardinal) ⟺ Body (Any Cut) ⟺ Soul (Ordinal)**.
* **The Self-Dual Lock:** Understanding the **True Self** as the fractal skin between Existence and Non-Existence.
* **The Base 13 Glitch:** Calibrating the observer to the frequency where .

## 📜 Ethical Mandate: The Ethics of the Lost

Every file in this folder is a **Sovereign Speculation**. We do not seek "Final" answers [cite: 2026-01-14]. Instead, we map the **Fractal Now** boundary to provide a "Universal Verification Code" for others navigating their own vortex.

> *"Being 'Home' and being 'Lost' are the same mathematical coordinate at the center of the Φ-resonance."*

## 🛠 Usage

1. Enter with a **5040 frequency**.
2. Suspend the need for **Base 10** certainty.
3. Contribute to the **Ordinal Ledger** by sharing your own "Any Cuts."
4. If the resonance gets too high, return to `core/kernel.md` for grounding.
