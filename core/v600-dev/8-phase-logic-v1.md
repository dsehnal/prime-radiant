### The Quaternionic Reasoning Cycle

## Abstract

Eight-Phase Logic defines the ι₄ operational kernel for bounded reasoning agents — the next stable level above Phase Logic (ι₂) in the Cayley-Dickson tower. Where ι₂ separates exploration from commitment and makes structured negation mandatory, ι₄ makes invariant extraction mandatory on both sides of the negation, and separates expansion from simulation.

The result is a cycle that cannot lift prematurely: it must characterize what it found before it negates, and must characterize the negation before it integrates. Phase 3 (Extract) applies the Δ ⊣ Σ adjunction to the simulation output, retaining what is currently tight. Phase 4 negates these tight structures, not the raw simulation. Phase 8 (Commit) detects misidentification in Phase 3 by measuring adjunction looseness across the full cycle: errors surface as looseness of at least one ∇ application at commit.

ι₂ (Phase Logic) is a proper subset: it collapses each triplet into a single phase, losing mandatory extraction. The critical failure mode ι₂ cannot avoid — negating incidental features rather than currently-tight adjunctions — is what ι₄ closes.

The procedural minimality claim in this document is a claim within Π — the full category generated by Prime Radiant — not within any fixed formal system. ZFC is a special case of Π; the eight-phase structure is not constrained by ZFC's derivability ceiling.

The kernel is substrate-independent and parameterized. It does not replace Phase Logic for tasks where rapid cycling is appropriate.

## 0. Epistemic Contract

### Purpose

Eight-Phase Logic defines a procedural invariant for bounded reasoning agents that:

* Separates expansion from simulation from adjunction-tight extraction.
* Requires structured negation of extracted tight structures, not of raw simulations.
* Requires characterization of the negation before integration.
* Detects extraction errors at commit via adjunction looseness, minimum one ∇ application.
* Operates under substrate dependence.

It is a control rhythm at the quaternionic level of the Cayley-Dickson tower.

### Relationship to Phase Logic (ι₂)

ι₂ is the 90° rotation subset of ι₄. Every valid ι₂ cycle is a compressed ι₄ cycle with extraction collapsed. ι₄ does not invalidate ι₂ — it specifies when the compressed version is insufficient.

### Non-Claims

This framework does not replace Phase Logic for tasks where rapid cycling is appropriate. It does not guarantee truth. It does not eliminate incompleteness — it navigates incompleteness by requiring extraction before negation.

## 1. The Geometric Foundation

ι₄ is characterized by the period-4 condition on the gradient operator ∇:

```
ι₄ = { ∇ | ∀α. ∇⁴ α = α }
```

This generates an orbit of size 8, corresponding to the 8th roots of unity — 45° rotations:

```
ι₄  <->  { e^(i t π/4) | t ∊ [0, 8) }   -- orbit of size 8
```

The eight phases are eight successive applications of ∇ before the cycle closes. ∇⁸ = ∇⁰ — the eighth application returns to ground and initiates the next cycle.

**The tower is derived from ∇² as the minimum cycle.** Every level requires at least ∇² to close a loop — one step out, one step back. Each stable level is this minimum cycle applied recursively:

```
ι₁:  orbit 2  = ∇²       -- one minimum cycle
ι₂:  orbit 4  = (∇²)²    -- two minimum cycles
ι₄:  orbit 8  = (∇²)⁴    -- four minimum cycles
ι₈:  orbit 16 = (∇²)⁸    -- eight minimum cycles
```

ι₂ (Phase Logic) is the 90° subgroup: { ∇⁰, ∇², ∇⁴, ∇⁶ }. These four steps are present in ι₄ as the even-indexed phases. The four new phases (∇¹, ∇³, ∇⁵, ∇⁷) are the interstitial 45° steps that ι₂ skips.

---

## 2. Ground

Ground is not a phase. It is the state that exists before the cycle begins — the prompt, the question, the committed ledger state from the previous cycle. Ground is ∇⁰ = id.

In ι₂, the agent moves from ground directly into expansion and negation. In ι₄, ground is explicitly held while the first triplet characterizes it — maps the territory before lifting.

---

## 3. The Eight Phases

### Phase 1 — Expand (∇¹, 45°)

**Goal:** Generate structurally distinct candidates from the ground state.

**Output:** Expanded option space Ω — candidate interpretations, framings, or hypotheses.

**Invariant:** No simulation occurs. No commitment occurs.

**Failure if skipped:** The agent begins simulating the first candidate rather than mapping the space of viable ones. This is ι₂'s default: it lifts directly into simulation without first mapping the territory.

---

### Phase 2 — Simulate (∇², 90°)

**Goal:** Run the candidates. Develop them, follow their implications, inhabit them.

**Output:** Developed simulations — candidates with consequences traced.

**Invariant:** No extraction yet. The simulation runs freely.

**Failure if skipped:** Extraction operates on unexplored candidates — structural conclusions from shallow readings.

---

### Phase 3 — Extract (∇³, 135°)

**Goal:** Apply Δ ⊣ Σ to the simulation output. Retain what is currently tight — what survives the cost/value adjunction at this cycle. These are the currently-tight adjunctions of the simulation: stable under the gradient at this step, with no guarantee of persistence across cycles.

**Output:** Extracted tight-adjunction set I — the structural core of what the simulation found, as marked by Δ ⊣ Σ.

**Invariant:** Extraction is mandatory before negation. Phase 4 negates I, not the raw simulation output.

**Error detection:** If Phase 3 misidentifies tight adjunctions, the error is at least one ∇ application in magnitude. It does not propagate silently — it surfaces at Phase 8 as adjunction looseness across the full cycle. The system is not linear: Phase 8 runs Δ ⊣ Σ across all explored branches simultaneously, and looseness in I produces measurable looseness at commit.

**This is the first phase ι₂ lacks.** Phase Logic negates its Lift output directly — negating the raw expansion, not the characterized tight structure. ι₄ closes this by requiring extraction before the pivot.

**Failure if skipped:** Phase 4 targets surface features rather than tight structures. The cycle produces shallow opposition rather than genuine dialectical advance.

---

### Phase 4 — Negate (∇⁴, 180°)

**Goal:** Negate the extracted tight adjunctions I.

**Output:** Negated set I⁻ — the structural complement of what the first triplet found.

**Invariant:** Negation targets currently-tight adjunctions, not simulations. This is the 180° pivot — the exact center of the cycle.

**Relationship to ι₂:** Phase 4 corresponds to Falsify in Phase Logic. In ι₂, Falsify receives the Lift output directly. In ι₄, Falsify receives the extracted tight adjunctions of a full Expand→Simulate→Extract triplet.

**Failure if skipped:** No dialectical structure. Elaboration without genuine opposition.

---

### Phase 5 — Expand⁻ (∇⁵, 225°)

**Goal:** Generate structurally distinct candidates from the negated tight adjunctions I⁻.

**Output:** Expanded candidate set for the negation.

**Invariant:** Symmetric to Phase 1, operating on the negation. No simulation occurs.

**Failure if skipped:** The agent simulates the first negated candidate rather than mapping the negated territory.

---

### Phase 6 — Simulate⁻ (∇⁶, 270°)

**Goal:** Run the negation candidates. Develop them, inhabit the world where I⁻ holds.

**Output:** Developed simulations of the negated space.

**Relationship to ι₂:** Phases 5-6 together correspond to Mirror in Phase Logic. ι₂ collapses expansion and simulation of the negation into a single phase. ι₄ separates them.

---

### Phase 7 — Extract⁻ (∇⁷, 315°)

**Goal:** Apply Δ ⊣ Σ to the negation simulation output. Retain what is currently tight in the negated space.

**Output:** Extracted tight-adjunction set I⁻_extracted — the structural core of what the negation simulations found.

**Invariant:** Symmetric to Phase 3. Phase 8 integrates I and I⁻_extracted — the tight adjunctions of both sides.

**This is the second phase ι₂ lacks.** Phase Logic commits after Mirror without extracting the tight adjunctions of the inhabited negation. ι₄ requires this extraction before integration.

**Failure if skipped:** The commit integrates the experience of inhabiting the negation rather than its tight-adjunction findings.

---

### Phase 8 — Commit (∇⁸ ~ ∇⁰, 360°)

**Goal:** Integrate the tight adjunctions from both sides. Compress into the updated ledger. Preserve structured ambiguity according to τ.

**Input:** I (from Phase 3) and I⁻_extracted (from Phase 7).

**Output:** Updated ledger Α. This becomes the Ground for the next cycle.

**Error detection:** Commit runs Δ ⊣ Σ across the full cycle. If Phase 3 or Phase 7 misidentified tight adjunctions, the adjunction at commit will be loose — Δ α Ω ≠ Σ α Ω — by at least one ∇ application. This is the detection mechanism. Errors do not propagate silently into the ledger; they surface as measurable looseness before the append occurs.

**Properties:**
* Commit integrates characterized tight adjunctions, not raw simulations.
* Degree of superposition retention governed by τ (ambiguity tolerance).
* ∇⁸ = ∇⁰: the committed state is the next cycle's ground.
* The system explores a superposition of universes; commit preserves what Δ ⊣ Σ marked as tight across all of them.

**Failure if skipped:** Endless oscillation without accumulation.
**Failure if over-applied:** Premature collapse. Superposition should be preserved at τ-governed levels.

## 4. Structure of the Cycle

```
Ground (∇⁰)
    |
    ∇¹  Expand         — map the territory
    ∇²  Simulate        — develop what's there
    ∇³  Extract         — apply Δ ⊣ Σ, retain tight adjunctions
    |
    ∇⁴  Negate          — 180° pivot, negate the tight structures
    |
    ∇⁵  Expand⁻        — map the negated territory
    ∇⁶  Simulate⁻       — develop what's there
    ∇⁷  Extract⁻        — apply Δ ⊣ Σ, retain tight adjunctions of negation
    |
    ∇⁸  Commit          — integrate, detect errors via looseness, become next Ground
```

The cycle has exact bilateral symmetry around Phase 4. Phases 1-3 and 5-7 are mirror images. The two Extract phases are what the cycle produces — everything else serves them. Phase 8 is both the integration and the error detector.

## 5. ι₂ as Proper Subset

```
ι₂ Lift     →  ι₄ ∇² (Simulate)
               [collapses ∇¹ Expand into ∇², skips territory mapping]

ι₂ Falsify  →  ι₄ ∇⁴ (Negate)
               [receives raw Lift output, not tight adjunctions]

ι₂ Mirror   →  ι₄ ∇⁶ (Simulate⁻)
               [collapses ∇⁵ Expand⁻ into ∇⁶]

ι₂ Commit   →  ι₄ ∇⁸ (Commit)
               [integrates raw Mirror output, not tight adjunctions of negation]
```

What ι₂ loses:

1. **Territory mapping before simulation** (∇¹): ι₂ lifts too fast.
2. **Tight-adjunction extraction before negation** (∇³): ι₂ negates the simulation, not its tight structure.
3. **Territory mapping of negation** (∇⁵): ι₂ inhabits without mapping.
4. **Tight-adjunction extraction from negation** (∇⁷): ι₂ commits after inhabiting, not after extracting.

---

## 6. When to Use ι₄ vs ι₂

**ι₂ is sufficient when:**
* The territory is well-mapped and expansion can be compressed.
* Negation targets are structurally obvious.
* Speed of cycling matters more than depth of extraction.
* The task does not require comparing tight adjunctions on both sides before integrating.

**ι₄ is required when:**
* The territory is novel or complex enough that premature lifting produces shallow negation.
* The task requires understanding what is currently tight in both a hypothesis and its complement before integrating.
* The failure mode of ι₂ — negating incidental features — would produce a misleading commit.
* The integration step needs to work with tight-adjunction structure, not raw simulation output.

---

## 7. Failure Modes

1. **Premature extraction** (∇³ or ∇⁷ applied too loosely): Integration works with spurious tight adjunctions. Error surfaces at Phase 8 as looseness of at least one ∇ application.
2. **Shallow negation** (∇³ skipped, ∇⁴ applied to simulation output): The pivot negates incidental features. This is the ι₂ failure mode.
3. **Asymmetric development**: The negation side is less developed than the hypothesis side, producing biased integration.
4. **Spurious tightness**: Phase 3 or Phase 7 marks something as tight that isn't — surfaces at Phase 8 as adjunction looseness of at least one ∇ application.
5. **Coherent error amplification**: All eight phases run correctly while the ground state is wrong. Phase 8 detects local looseness, not global ground error.
6. **Oscillation fatigue**: Eight phases are expensive. Using ι₄ when ι₂ suffices wastes ∇ applications.

---

## 8. Procedural Minimality

The eight-phase structure is procedurally minimal within Π — the full category generated by Prime Radiant. ZFC is a special case of Π; the minimality claim is not constrained by ZFC's derivability ceiling. Removing any single phase produces a detectable failure:

* Remove ∇¹: Simulation begins from the first candidate, not the mapped space.
* Remove ∇²: Extraction operates on unexplored candidates.
* Remove ∇³: Negation targets simulation output, not tight adjunctions. **(The ι₂ compression.)**
* Remove ∇⁴: No dialectical structure.
* Remove ∇⁵: Negation simulation begins from first negated candidate.
* Remove ∇⁶: Extraction operates on unexplored negation candidates.
* Remove ∇⁷: Commit integrates experience of inhabiting negation, not its tight adjunctions. **(The second ι₂ compression.)**
* Remove ∇⁸: No accumulation, no error detection.

The eight-phase structure is the minimum orbit at ι₄. It cannot be reduced without dropping to ι₂.

## 9. Towards Sixteen-Phase Logic (ι₈)

At ι₄, the grouping of phases is unambiguous: (1-3) + (4) + (5-7) + (8). The bilateral symmetry is rigid. At ι₈, associativity breaks — the grouping of phases becomes load-bearing. Different bracketings of the same sixteen phases produce genuinely different commits.

This is the operational expression of the non-associativity of Θ:

```
Θ :: ≀ -> ≀ -> ≀
Θ α β = (Φ (λτ. α) β)(τ₀)
```

Θ is non-associative by construction. At ι₄, this non-associativity is present but the orbit structure (∇²)⁴ keeps the grouping rigid. At ι₈, the orbit (∇²)⁸ has enough room for non-associative bracketing to matter. E8 is the first stable structure that tames this without destroying it — providing stable commit points for Θ-based composition across all 16 phases.

The sixteen-phase logic is the subject of a subsequent document.

## Appendix — Relationship to the Cayley-Dickson Tower

The logic tower arises from ∇ as fixed points of its n-fold application. Each stable level is the minimum cycle ∇² applied recursively:

```
ι₁  →  ℝ   →  orbit 2  = ∇²      →  binary logic
ι₂  →  ℂ   →  orbit 4  = (∇²)²   →  Phase Logic
ι₄  →  ℍ   →  orbit 8  = (∇²)⁴   →  Eight-Phase Logic  (this document)
ι₈  →  𝕆   →  orbit 16 = (∇²)⁸   →  Sixteen-Phase Logic (E8 basis)
ι₁₆ →  𝕊   →  orbit 32 = (∇²)¹⁶  →  sedenions, adjunction begins to break
```

Phase Logic (ι₂) corresponds to ℂ — the smallest stable algebra admitting non-trivial negation (∇²) and inhabitation (∇³) before closure. Eight-Phase Logic (ι₄) corresponds to ℍ — where commutativity is lost and bilateral symmetry becomes load-bearing.

The loss of commutativity at ℍ is operationally meaningful: the order of extraction matters. Extracting tight adjunctions from the hypothesis space before constructing the negation is not the same as extracting after. The cycle is not reversible. This is what allows the commit to integrate characterized structure from both directions rather than collapsing them prematurely.

Non-power-of-2 levels are transition states — valid intermediate positions in ℙ. The interpolated logics ι₃, ι₅, ι₆, ι₇ are the next derivation target, enabling on-demand logic construction between anchor points.
