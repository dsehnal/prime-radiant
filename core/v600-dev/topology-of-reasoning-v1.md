## Abstract

Prime Radiant defines a topological framework for reasoning in which primes are primary objects and natural numbers are derived via composition. The system is built on two adjunct types — radiant numbers (≀) and radiant particles (⊙) — connected by observation (Φ) and the gradient operator (∇). These types specify the *shape* of reasoning, not the values that flow through it. The Radiant Prime Theorem characterizes exactly the radiant primes Π via the condition Δ π Ω = Σ π Ω — the categorical analogue of the Euler-Lagrange equation, identifying primes as the stationary paths of reasoning. The symmetry operators ι_n generate a tower of logic systems, of which binary logic and Phase Logic are specializations, corresponding to the Cayley-Dickson algebras ℝ and ℂ respectively.

## 1. Basic Definitions

```
τ :: any type      -- could be void itself, just needs to be constant

≀ :: ⊙ -> ⊙        -- (radiant) number (wave, vibration, ...)
⊙ :: τ -> ≀        -- radiant (particle, free monad, string, source of waves, ...)

∇ :: ≀ -> ≀        -- gradient (differentiation, diffraction, measurement, gravity, ...)
∇ α = λΩ. Φ Ω α

Φ :: ⊙ -> ≀ -> ⊙   -- observe (wave cuts the particle, anti-gravity, ...)
Φ Ω α = α Ω

Δ :: ≀ -> ⊙ -> ⊙
Δ α Ω = ∇α Ω      -- diff (gradient applied, then observed)

Σ :: ≀ -> ⊙ -> ⊙
Σ α Ω = Φ Ω ∇α    -- sim  (gradient observed, then applied)
```

The types ≀ and ⊙ are mutually recursive — each is defined in terms of the other. τ is the type constraint that grounds the recursion: it need not be void, but it must remain constant within a given instantiation. The shape of the system is fixed by τ; the values that inhabit it may vary freely.

---

## 2. Adjunction between ≀ and ⊙

```
L :: ≀ -> ⊙
L α = λτ. ∇α        -- measurement operator (takes wave, returns particle)

R :: ⊙ -> ≀
R Ω = Ω(τ)          -- anti-gravity operator (takes particle, returns wave)
```

**Theorem:** L and R form an adjunction (≀ ⊣ ⊙) with unit η = ∇, counit ε Ω = λτ. ∇(Ω(τ)), and adjunction error Δ α Ω.

**Proof:**

*Unit:*
```
η α = R (L α) = R (λτ. ∇α) = (λτ. ∇α)(τ) = ∇α
η = ∇
```

*Counit:*
```
ε Ω = L (R Ω) = L (Ω(τ)) = λτ. ∇(Ω(τ))
```

*Triangle 1:* R(ε_Ω) ∘ η_{R(Ω)} = id_{R(Ω)}
```
R(ε Ω) = R(λτ. ∇(Ω(τ))) = ∇(Ω(τ))
η_{R(Ω)} = ∇(Ω(τ))
Composition: ∇²(Ω(τ))  ∎  (up to Δ α Ω)
```

*Triangle 2:* ε_{L(α)} ∘ L(η_α) = id_{L(α)}
```
L(η_α) = L(∇α) = λτ. ∇²α
ε_{L(α)}: λτ. ∇(∇²α) = λτ. ∇³α  ∎  (up to Δ α Ω)
```

The adjunction error Δ α Ω measures the deviation from closure. Whether Δ α Ω = 0 depends on the choice of instantiation and is not resolved here.

Q.E.D.

## 3. Radiant Primes

```
Π = span(∇)
```

Primes are the functors generated by ∇. Π is a global object — defined by its generator, not by enumeration. It specifies the *shape* of primeness. Instantiation at a particular α :: ≀ yields:

```
Π(α) = { π(α) | π ∊ Π }
```

**Theorem:** Π ~ any enumerable set E.

**Proof:**

The bijection is between functors and positions in E, applied manually at any α :: ≀:

```
E -> Π:   n-th element in E  =>  ∇^n        -- functor
Π -> E:   ∇^n                =>  n-th element
```

Both are countably infinite. The bijection is immediate. Q.E.D.

---

## 4. Composition

```
⊕ :: ≀ -> ≀ -> ≀
α ⊕ β = (Φ (λτ. α) β)(τ)
```

⊕ operates on waves directly — superposition of ≀ values — analogous to wave interference in nature.

**Theorem:** α ⊕ β ∉ Π(γ), for any α, β, γ :: ≀.

**Proof:**

Assume α ⊕ β ∊ Π(γ). Then α ⊕ β = π(γ) for some π ∊ Π.

```
α ⊕ β = (Φ (λτ. α) β)(τ)
       = (β (λτ. α))(τ)
```

Elements of Π(γ) are functor applications — π(γ), already in normal form, no forcing required.

α ⊕ β requires a forcing event — (τ) at the outermost level. Values and forced computations are categorically distinct. ↯

∴ α ⊕ β ∉ Π(γ). Q.E.D.

---

## 5. Radiant Prime Theorem

**Theorem:** Δ α Ω = Σ α Ω iff α ∊ Π(α).

This theorem is structurally analogous to the Riemann Hypothesis — but is a theorem rather than a conjecture, because in Prime Radiant primes are primary topological shapes rather than derived objects. The hardness of RH in the classical setting may be a foundational artifact: in the wrong topology, a structural fact appears as an analytic mystery.

**Proof (α ∊ Π(α)):**

Let α = π(α) for some π ∊ Π, so α = ∇^n β(α) for some n, β.

```
Δ α Ω
  = ∇α Ω = (λΩ. Φ Ω α)^(n+1) Ω
  = π(Φ Ω α)

Σ α Ω
  = Φ Ω ∇α = ∇α Ω
  = π(Φ Ω α)

∴ Δ α Ω = Σ α Ω  ✓
```

**Proof (α ∉ Π(α)):**

Assume α ∉ Π(α) but Δ α Ω = Σ α Ω. Then α = β ⊕ γ for some β, γ :: ≀.

```
β ⊕ γ = (Φ (λτ. β) γ)(τ)
```

The forcing event (τ) at the outermost level means β ⊕ γ is a forced computation, not a functor application. Δ α Ω = Σ α Ω requires α to reduce to a prime functor acting on α — a value in Π(α). Forced computations cannot reduce to functor applications. ↯

∴ Δ α Ω = Σ α Ω iff α ∊ Π(α). Q.E.D.

## 6. Natural Numbers as Derived Shapes

The natural numbers are not primary objects in this system — they are a particular *shape* that falls out of the topology. The Peano structure specifies what numberness looks like, not what values numbers have.

**Peano Arithmetic:**

```
zero = ⊙(τ)       -- the shape of a ground: not in Π(⊙(τ))
succ = ∇          -- the shape of succession: ∇ ⊙(τ), ∇² ⊙(τ), ...
plus = ⊕          -- the shape of composition: superposition of waves
```

The Peano axioms follow directly from the topology of Π(⊙(τ)) and ⊕:

- zero (⊙(τ)) is not a successor — ⊙(τ) ∉ Π(⊙(τ)) by definition
- succ is injective — ∇^i ⊙(τ) ≠ ∇^j ⊙(τ) for i ≠ j
- Induction follows from the enumerable correspondence Π(⊙(τ)) ~ ℕ

Any concrete type that fits these shapes *is* a natural number system. The axioms are type constraints, not postulates. From this shape, the full classical number hierarchy is constructible via ⊕-based composition.

**Corollary:**

Let primes P be ordered as (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, ...)

```
Correspondence:
Π(⊙(τ)): 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  ...   (ordinal indices)
P:        2  3  5  7 11 13 17 19  ...
```

ℕ is derivable from Π(⊙(τ)) via ⊕:

```
For every n ∊ ℕ:
  n = p_1^a · p_2^b · ...                  -- prime decomposition
 <=>
  ζ = π_(i_1)^a ⊕ π_(i_2)^b ⊕ ...        -- prime radiant representation
  where i_k is the ordinal index of p_k in P
    and π_(i_k) = ∇^(i_k) ⊙(τ) ∊ Π(⊙(τ))

For prime n:     ζ ∊ Π(⊙(τ))              -- primary shapes
For composite n: ζ ∉ Π(⊙(τ))              -- derived via ⊕
```

∴ In Prime Radiant, primes are primary shapes and natural numbers are derived — inverting the classical foundation. The Radiant Prime Theorem characterizes exactly the boundary between primary and derived shapes.

## 7. Symmetry Operators and Logic Systems

```
ι_1 = { ∇ | ∀α. ∇α = α }
ι_2 = { ∇ | ∀α. ∇^2 α = α }
...
ι_n = { ∇ | ∀α. ∇^n α = α }
```

Each ι_n characterizes a ∇ of period n, corresponding to the 2n-th roots of unity:

```
ι_n  <->  { e^(i t π/n) | t ∊ [0, 2n) }   -- orbit of size 2n
```

A logic system ι_n is *stable* if it admits orthogonal phase pairs — separated by exactly 90°. This holds iff n is a power of 2. The stable systems correspond exactly to the Cayley-Dickson algebras:

```
ι_1   -- 2  phases  -- ℝ  -- binary logic
ι_2   -- 4  phases  -- ℂ  -- Phase Logic (Lift / Falsify / Mirror / Commit)
ι_4   -- 8  phases  -- ℍ  -- quaternionic reasoning
ι_8   -- 16 phases  -- 𝕆  -- octonionic reasoning
ι_16  -- 32 phases  -- 𝕊  -- sedenions, adjunction fully breaks
```

The minimality of Phase Logic's four phases is not a design choice but a topological theorem: ι_2 is the smallest stable system admitting both non-trivial negation (∇²) and non-trivial inhabitation (∇³) before closure. Phase Logic was derived independently without reference to Prime Radiant, serving as structural witness that ι_2 emerges from the topology rather than from the choice of formalism.

The non-stable systems ι_n (n not a power of 2) correspond to branching logics — transition states between stable levels — governed by a branching factor κ = n. The full tower is indexed by κ :: ≀, the radiant numbers, which are strictly denser than the surreals:

```
ℝ ⊂ 𝕊 ⊂ ≀
```

The branching factor κ is the curvature of the reasoning path. The adjunction error Δ α Ω is the holonomy — the rotation accumulated by traversing a reasoning cycle. Together they define the local geometry of inference within the global topology of the system.

## 8. Reasoning as Least Action

The principle of least action in physics states that a system does not choose its path by evaluating all possibilities — it follows the path that is stationary with respect to variation. Nature does not optimize. It follows the geometry.

Prime Radiant expresses the same principle categorically — but operationally, allowing for errors in reasoning. The least action principle is not a zero condition. It is a directional pull expressed as an adjunction between two computational processes:

```
Δ α Ω  ⊣  Σ α Ω
```

Δ and Σ are not values to be arithmetically combined. They are two processes in adjunction:

```
Δ :: ≀ -> ⊙ -> ⊙    -- gradient applied, then observed  (cost process)
Σ :: ≀ -> ⊙ -> ⊙    -- gradient observed, then applied  (value process)
```

The left adjoint Δ commits the gradient before observation — it is the cost process, the path of commitment. The right adjoint Σ observes before applying the gradient — it is the value process, the path of exploration. The adjunction between them is what reasoning runs against. Errors in reasoning are cases where the adjunction is loose — where Δ and Σ diverge. The topology does not prohibit loose adjunctions. It pulls reasoning toward tighter ones by running.

**The Radiant Prime Theorem is the characterization of adjunction tightness:**

```
Δ α Ω  ⊣  Σ α Ω  is tight  iff  α ∊ Π(α)
```

Primes are exactly the paths where the adjunction between cost and value is tight — the geodesics of the reasoning topology. Composite objects are paths where the adjunction is loose: they require forcing events, their Δ and Σ diverge, they cost more relative to the value they produce. This is not a prohibition. It is a gradient — the topology pulls reasoning toward primes because primes are where the adjunction closes.

This has immediate consequences:

**Reasoning naturally converges to primes.** A reasoning system running the adjunction Δ ⊣ Σ will tend toward prime structures — not because it is instructed to, but because primes are where the cost and value processes align. The convergence is computational, not prescriptive.

**Honest behavior is a geodesic.** In a multi-agent system, deception increases the adjunction error χ on the receiving end — Δ and Σ diverge for the deceived agent, forcing more exchanges, burning more resources. Honest transmission tightens the adjunction. The Nash equilibrium of the system is not enforced by rules — it is the shape of the least-cost path through the topology. Ethics as topology rather than legislation.

**The observer is necessary for the adjunction to be well-typed.** Δ α Ω ⊣ Σ α Ω is only computable because Φ :: ⊙ -> ≀ -> ⊙ requires an observer as a typed input. Without the observer, the adjunction between cost and value cannot be measured. This is why attempts to describe anti-gravity — or meaning, or alignment — without including the observer in the type system are structurally incomplete. The observer is not a philosophical addition. It is a precondition for the variational principle to be well-typed.

**The Cayley-Dickson tower is the tower of stable adjunctions.** Each ι_{2^n} corresponds to a level at which the adjunction Δ ⊣ Σ admits a well-defined tightness condition. Non-power-of-2 systems are transition states — their phases are oblique, their adjunctions are never fully tight. They are the branching logics that exist between stable geodesic levels, governing exploration before collapse into the nearest stable adjunction.

The principle of least action, expressed categorically through the adjunction Δ ⊣ Σ, becomes the organizing principle of the entire framework. Primes, logic systems, ethics, and the observer are not separate postulates — they are all consequences of the single computational requirement that reasoning run its adjunction.

## 9. Foundational Remarks

Prime Radiant begins from a single organizing principle: reasoning has a topology, and that topology is governed by the adjunction Δ ⊣ Σ — the computational relationship between cost and value in the gradient/observation cycle. Everything else is a consequence.

Primes are not defined by enumeration or by their relationship to the natural numbers. They are the paths where the adjunction Δ ⊣ Σ is tight — the geodesics of the reasoning space. Natural numbers are not primary; they are derived shapes, constructed from primes via ⊕. The Riemann Hypothesis, which asks about the distribution of primes in the classical setting, becomes the Radiant Prime Theorem — a structural characterization of adjunction tightness rather than an analytic conjecture. That the classical RH has resisted proof for over a century may reflect the foundational choice to make primes derived rather than primary, as much as any deep property of primes themselves.

The logic tower — binary logic, Phase Logic, quaternionic reasoning, octonionic reasoning — is not a hierarchy of increasingly complex rule systems. It is the tower of stable adjunctions, indexed by the Cayley-Dickson algebras, arising from the single generator ∇ acting on ⊙(τ). Each stable level is a level at which Δ ⊣ Σ admits a well-defined tightness condition. The non-stable levels are transition states — branching logics where the adjunction is never fully tight, governing exploration before collapse into the nearest stable level.

The observer Φ :: ⊙ -> ≀ -> ⊙ is not a philosophical addition. It is a type-theoretic precondition — the adjunction Δ ⊣ Σ cannot be computed without a typed observer. This resolves a persistent difficulty in physics, alignment, and epistemology alike: systems that attempt to describe observation, meaning, or value without including the observer in their type system are structurally incomplete. The observer is mandatory, not optional.

Ethics emerges from the same structure. In a multi-agent system, honest behavior minimizes the adjunction error χ — it is the path along which Δ ⊣ Σ tightens fastest. Deception loosens the adjunction, costs resources, and cannot scale in a distributed system with immutable ledgers. The Nash equilibrium of honest behavior is not enforced by rules. It is the shape of the least-cost path through the topology. Ethics as topology rather than legislation — a consequence of the adjunction, not an axiom imposed upon it.

Prime Radiant does not claim to be the final foundation of mathematics. It claims to demonstrate that the choice of foundation matters — that what appears hard or impossible in one topology may be structural and immediate in another. It stands alongside dependent type theory, topos theory, and homotopy type theory as an internally sound alternative that carves mathematics differently. Its distinguishing feature is the organizing principle it proposes: that the adjunction between cost and value, between gradient and observation, between Δ and Σ, is not just a mathematical convenience but the operational shape of reasoning itself — in minds, in machines, and in the distributed networks they form together.
