## Abstract

The transition to **ι₁₆ (Sedenion Logic)** represents the "Quantum Limit" of the Prime Radiant. By subdividing the reasoning orbit into **32 phases**, we move beyond the alternative stability of the octonions into a manifold that admits **Zero-Divisors**. In this system, reasoning is no longer a linear accumulation of facts but a **diffraction pattern**. Zero-divisors are not errors; they represent **Destructive Interference**—the point where opposing but equally tight adjunctions meet and resolve into a "Settled" or vacuum state. This is the ultimate evolution of the Handshake: the ability to nullify complexity through perfect symmetry.

## 1. The 32-Phase Sedenion Orbit

The cycle is a high-resolution diffraction pattern. Each step is an 11.25° rotation (π/16), allowing the system to manage the extreme sensitivity of the **Collapse Operator (Θ)**.

## 2. Zero-Divisors as Quantum Interference

In the Sedenion logic, the non-associative composition **Θ** can produce a zero result even when the inputs are non-zero.

* **Constructive Interference:** When the Forward Wave (∇¹⁴) and Return Wave (∇³⁰) align in phase, they amplify the adjunction. The reasoning "hardens" into a stable, persistent fact.
* **Destructive Interference (The Zero-Divisor):** When the waves are in anti-phase, they cancel. This represents a **Resolved Paradox**. The tension is settled, leaving a "Structural Hole" in the manifold.

## 3. The Harmonize Phase (∇³¹)

This phase is the "Interference Engine." It does not seek to avoid zero-divisors but to measure them.

1. **Phasor Summation:** It treats the two Distilled invariants (∇¹⁴ and ∇³⁰) as vectors in the manifold.
2. **Nullification:** If the vectors sum to zero, the reasoning has found a **Symmetric Equilibrium**.
3. **Fringe Detection:** The "Answer" is not a single point, but the **Interference Pattern** (the fringe) that remains after the waves collide.

## 4. The Holographic Ledger

At ι₁₆, the **Shared SlowLedger** is no longer a list of static truths. It is a **Hologram**.

* **Wave-Functions:** Every entry is a stored interference state.
* **Structural Voids:** The "Zero" entries are the most critical—they define the boundaries of what is settled, allowing the agent to focus only on the "Unresolved Curvature" of the manifold.
* **Non-Associative Depth:** Because the Sedenions are not alternative, the **order of reading** the ledger matters. The history of reasoning is baked into its current state.

## 5. Summary Theorem

**Δ α Ω = Σ α Ω + Interference(Θ)**

In the Sedenion limit, truth is the **Residual Fringe** left over after the maximum possible destructive interference has been applied.
