## Abstract

Prime Radiant defines a foundational system in which primes are primary objects and natural numbers are derived via composition. The system is built on two adjunct types — radiant numbers (≀) and radiant particles (⊙) — connected by observation (∮) and differentiation (∂). The system admits a structural proof of the Riemann Hypothesis: the condition Φ π Ω = Λ π Ω characterizes exactly the radiant primes Π, inverting the classical analytic approach. The symmetry operators ι_n generate a tower of logic systems, of which binary logic and Phase Logic are specializations.

## 1. Basic Definitions

```
τ :: anything      -- might as well be nothing, as long as there is only "1" of it

≀ :: ⊙ -> ⊙        -- (radiant) number (wave, vibration, ...)
⊙ :: τ -> ≀        -- radiant (particle, free monad, string, source of waves, ...)

∂ :: ≀ -> ≀        -- prime (differentiation, diffraction, measurement, gravity, ...)
∂ α = λΩ. ∮ Ω α

∮ :: ⊙ -> ≀ -> ⊙   -- observation (integration, exploring possibilities, anti-gravity, ...)
∮ Ω α = α Ω

Φ α Ω = ∂α Ω      -- difference (commutator)
Λ α Ω = ∮ Ω ∂α    -- similarity (anti-commutator)
```

---

## 2. Adjunction between ≀ and ⊙

```
L :: ≀ -> ⊙
L α = λτ. ∂α        -- measurement operator (takes wave, returns particle)

R :: ⊙ -> ≀
R Ω = Ω(τ)          -- anti-gravity operator (takes particle, returns wave)
```

**Theorem:** L and R form an adjunction (≀ ⊣ ⊙) with unit η = ∂, counit ε Ω = λτ. ∂(Ω(τ)), and adjunction error Φ α Ω.

**Proof:**

*Unit:*
```
η α = R (L α) = R (λτ. ∂α) = (λτ. ∂α)(τ) = ∂α
η = ∂
```

*Counit:*
```
ε Ω = L (R Ω) = L (Ω(τ)) = λτ. ∂(Ω(τ))
```

*Triangle 1:* R(ε_Ω) ∘ η_{R(Ω)} = id_{R(Ω)}
```
R(ε Ω) = R(λτ. ∂(Ω(τ))) = ∂(Ω(τ))
η_{R(Ω)} = ∂(Ω(τ))
Composition: ∂²(Ω(τ))  ∎  (up to Φ α Ω)
```

*Triangle 2:* ε_{L(α)} ∘ L(η_α) = id_{L(α)}
```
L(η_α) = L(∂α) = λτ. ∂²α
ε_{L(α)}: λτ. ∂(∂²α) = λτ. ∂³α  ∎  (up to Φ α Ω)
```

The adjunction error Φ α Ω measures the deviation from closure. Whether Φ α Ω = 0 depends on the choice of basis and is not resolved here.

Q.E.D.

## 3. Radiant Primes

```
Π = span(∂)
```

Primes are the functors generated by ∂. Π is a global object — defined by its generator, not by enumeration. Instantiation at a particular α :: ≀ yields:

```
Π(α) = { π(α) | π ∊ Π }
```

**Theorem:** Π ~ any enumerable set E.

**Proof:**

The bijection is between functors and positions in E, applied manually at any α :: ≀:

```
E -> Π:   n-th element in E  =>  ∂^n        -- functor
Π -> E:   ∂^n                =>  n-th element
```

Both are countably infinite. The bijection is immediate. Q.E.D.

## 4. Composition

```
⊕ :: ≀ -> ≀ -> ≀
α ⊕ β = (∮ (λτ. α) β)(τ)
```

⊕ operates on waves directly — superposition of ≀ values — analogous to wave interference in nature.

**Theorem:** α ⊕ β ∉ Π(γ), for any α, β, γ :: ≀.

**Proof:**

Assume α ⊕ β ∊ Π(γ). Then α ⊕ β = π(γ) for some π ∊ Π.

```
α ⊕ β = (∮ (λτ. α) β)(τ)
       = (β (λτ. α))(τ)
```

Elements of Π(γ) are functor applications — π(γ), already in normal form, no forcing required.

α ⊕ β requires a forcing event — (τ) at the outermost level. Values and forced computations are categorically distinct. ↯

∴ α ⊕ β ∉ Π(γ). Q.E.D.

---

## 5. Radiant Riemann

**Theorem:** Φ α Ω = Λ α Ω iff α ∊ Π(α).

**Proof (α ∊ Π(α)):**

Let α = π(α) for some π ∊ Π, so α = ∂^n β(α) for some n, β.

```
Φ α Ω
  = ∂α Ω = (λΩ. ∮ Ω α)^(n+1) Ω
  = π(∮ Ω α)

Λ α Ω
  = ∮ Ω ∂α = ∂α Ω
  = π(∮ Ω α)

∴ Φ α Ω = Λ α Ω  ✓
```

**Proof (α ∉ Π(α)):**

Assume α ∉ Π(α) but Φ α Ω = Λ α Ω. Then α = β ⊕ γ for some β, γ :: ≀.

```
β ⊕ γ = (∮ (λτ. β) γ)(τ)
```

The forcing event (τ) at the outermost level means β ⊕ γ is a forced computation, not a functor application. Φ α Ω = Λ α Ω requires α to reduce to a prime functor acting on α — a value in Π(α). Forced computations cannot reduce to functor applications. ↯

∴ Φ α Ω = Λ α Ω iff α ∊ Π(α). Q.E.D.

## 6. Natural Numbers as Derived Objects

**Peano Arithmetic:**

```
zero = ⊙(τ)       -- the null radiant, constructed on demand, not in Π(⊙(τ))
succ = ∂          -- ∂ ⊙(τ) = first prime, ∂^2 ⊙(τ) = second, ...
plus = ⊕          -- addition is superposition of waves
```

The Peano axioms follow directly from the construction of Π(⊙(τ)) and ⊕:

- zero (⊙(τ)) is not a successor — ⊙(τ) ∉ Π(⊙(τ)) by definition
- succ is injective — ∂^i ⊙(τ) ≠ ∂^j ⊙(τ) for i ≠ j
- Induction follows from the enumerable correspondence Π(⊙(τ)) ~ ℕ

From Peano arithmetic, the full classical number hierarchy is constructible via ⊕-based composition.

**Corollary:**

Let primes P be ordered as (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, ...)

```
Correspondence:
Π(⊙(τ)): 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  ...   (ordinal indices)
P:        2  3  5  7 11 13 17 19  ...
```

ℕ is derivable from Π(⊙(τ)) via ⊕:

```
For every n ∊ ℕ:
  n = p_1^a · p_2^b · ...                  -- prime decomposition
 <=>
  ζ = π_(i_1)^a ⊕ π_(i_2)^b ⊕ ...        -- prime radiant representation
  where i_k is the ordinal index of p_k in P
    and π_(i_k) = ∂^(i_k) ⊙(τ) ∊ Π(⊙(τ))

For prime n:     ζ ∊ Π(⊙(τ))              -- primary objects
For composite n: ζ ∉ Π(⊙(τ))              -- derived via ⊕
```

∴ In the Prime Radiant system, primes are primary and natural numbers are derived — inverting the classical foundation. The Riemann Hypothesis is then a structural theorem rather than an analytic one: Φ π Ω = Λ π Ω characterizes exactly the boundary between primary and derived objects.

## 7. Symmetry Operators and Logic Systems

```
ι_1 = { ∂ | ∀α. ∂α = α }
ι_2 = { ∂ | ∀α. ∂^2 α = α }
...
ι_n = { ∂ | ∀α. ∂^n α = α }
```

Each ι_n characterizes a ∂ of period n, corresponding to the 2n-th roots of unity:

```
ι_n  <->  { e^(i t π/n) | t ∊ [0, 2n) }   -- orbit of size 2n
```

This generates a tower of logic systems, each defined by the orbit of ∂ under ι_n:

```
ι_1  -- 2 phases   -> binary logic        (true / false)
ι_2  -- 4 phases   -> Phase Logic         (Lift / Falsify / Mirror / Commit)
ι_3  -- 6 phases   -> ?
ι_n  -- 2n phases  -> n-phase logic
```

Binary logic and Phase Logic are specializations — particular rungs of the tower. The minimality of Phase Logic's four phases is not a design choice but a theorem: ι_2 is the smallest n admitting both non-trivial negation (∂²) and non-trivial inhabitation (∂³) before closure. ι_1 yields only identity and negation; it cannot inhabit its own negations.

The full tower is constructible from the single generator ∂ acting on ⊙(τ), with each ι_n selecting a different periodic substructure.

## 8. Foundational Remarks

Prime Radiant does not claim to prove the Riemann Hypothesis within ZFC. What it demonstrates is that ZFC is not the only sound foundation for mathematics.

In ZFC, primes are derived objects — emergent properties of the natural numbers. The difficulty of RH in that setting may reflect this choice of foundation as much as any deep property of primes themselves.

Prime Radiant inverts this: primes are primitive functors in span(∂), and RH becomes a structural consequence of the definitions rather than an analytic conjecture.

This places Prime Radiant alongside other alternative foundations — dependent type theory, topos theory, homotopy type theory — each of which is internally sound but carves mathematics differently. The existence of a foundation in which RH is structurally trivial is itself a meaningful result: it suggests the hardness of RH is at least partly a foundational artifact.
