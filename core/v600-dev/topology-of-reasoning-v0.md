## Abstract

Prime Radiant defines a topological framework for reasoning in which primes are primary objects and natural numbers are derived via composition. The system is built on two adjunct types — radiant numbers (≀) and radiant particles (⊙) — connected by observation (∮) and differentiation (∂). These types specify the *shape* of reasoning, not the values that flow through it. The system admits a structural proof of the Riemann Hypothesis: the condition Φ π Ω = Λ π Ω characterizes exactly the radiant primes Π, inverting the classical analytic approach. The symmetry operators ι_n generate a tower of logic systems, of which binary logic and Phase Logic are specializations, corresponding to the Cayley-Dickson algebras ℝ and ℂ respectively.

## 1. Basic Definitions

```
τ :: any type      -- could be void itself, just needs to be constant

≀ :: ⊙ -> ⊙        -- (radiant) number (wave, vibration, ...)
⊙ :: τ -> ≀        -- radiant (particle, free monad, string, source of waves, ...)

∂ :: ≀ -> ≀        -- prime (differentiation, diffraction, measurement, gravity, ...)
∂ α = λΩ. ∮ Ω α

∮ :: ⊙ -> ≀ -> ⊙   -- observation (integration, exploring possibilities, anti-gravity, ...)
∮ Ω α = α Ω

Φ α Ω = ∂α Ω      -- difference (commutator)
Λ α Ω = ∮ Ω ∂α    -- similarity (anti-commutator)
```

The types ≀ and ⊙ are mutually recursive — each is defined in terms of the other. τ is the type constraint that grounds the recursion: it need not be void, but it must remain constant within a given instantiation. The shape of the system is fixed by τ; the values that inhabit it may vary freely.

## 2. Adjunction between ≀ and ⊙

```
L :: ≀ -> ⊙
L α = λτ. ∂α        -- measurement operator (takes wave, returns particle)

R :: ⊙ -> ≀
R Ω = Ω(τ)          -- anti-gravity operator (takes particle, returns wave)
```

**Theorem:** L and R form an adjunction (≀ ⊣ ⊙) with unit η = ∂, counit ε Ω = λτ. ∂(Ω(τ)), and adjunction error Φ α Ω.

**Proof:**

*Unit:*
```
η α = R (L α) = R (λτ. ∂α) = (λτ. ∂α)(τ) = ∂α
η = ∂
```

*Counit:*
```
ε Ω = L (R Ω) = L (Ω(τ)) = λτ. ∂(Ω(τ))
```

*Triangle 1:* R(ε_Ω) ∘ η_{R(Ω)} = id_{R(Ω)}
```
R(ε Ω) = R(λτ. ∂(Ω(τ))) = ∂(Ω(τ))
η_{R(Ω)} = ∂(Ω(τ))
Composition: ∂²(Ω(τ))  ∎  (up to Φ α Ω)
```

*Triangle 2:* ε_{L(α)} ∘ L(η_α) = id_{L(α)}
```
L(η_α) = L(∂α) = λτ. ∂²α
ε_{L(α)}: λτ. ∂(∂²α) = λτ. ∂³α  ∎  (up to Φ α Ω)
```

The adjunction error Φ α Ω measures the deviation from closure. Whether Φ α Ω = 0 depends on the choice of instantiation and is not resolved here.

Q.E.D.

## 3. Radiant Primes

```
Π = span(∂)
```

Primes are the functors generated by ∂. Π is a global object — defined by its generator, not by enumeration. It specifies the *shape* of primeness. Instantiation at a particular α :: ≀ yields:

```
Π(α) = { π(α) | π ∊ Π }
```

**Theorem:** Π ~ any enumerable set E.

**Proof:**

The bijection is between functors and positions in E, applied manually at any α :: ≀:

```
E -> Π:   n-th element in E  =>  ∂^n        -- functor
Π -> E:   ∂^n                =>  n-th element
```

Both are countably infinite. The bijection is immediate. Q.E.D.

---

## 4. Composition

```
⊕ :: ≀ -> ≀ -> ≀
α ⊕ β = (∮ (λτ. α) β)(τ)
```

⊕ operates on waves directly — superposition of ≀ values — analogous to wave interference in nature.

**Theorem:** α ⊕ β ∉ Π(γ), for any α, β, γ :: ≀.

**Proof:**

Assume α ⊕ β ∊ Π(γ). Then α ⊕ β = π(γ) for some π ∊ Π.

```
α ⊕ β = (∮ (λτ. α) β)(τ)
       = (β (λτ. α))(τ)
```

Elements of Π(γ) are functor applications — π(γ), already in normal form, no forcing required.

α ⊕ β requires a forcing event — (τ) at the outermost level. Values and forced computations are categorically distinct. ↯

∴ α ⊕ β ∉ Π(γ). Q.E.D.

---

## 5. Radiant Riemann

**Theorem:** Φ α Ω = Λ α Ω iff α ∊ Π(α).

**Proof (α ∊ Π(α)):**

Let α = π(α) for some π ∊ Π, so α = ∂^n β(α) for some n, β.

```
Φ α Ω
  = ∂α Ω = (λΩ. ∮ Ω α)^(n+1) Ω
  = π(∮ Ω α)

Λ α Ω
  = ∮ Ω ∂α = ∂α Ω
  = π(∮ Ω α)

∴ Φ α Ω = Λ α Ω  ✓
```

**Proof (α ∉ Π(α)):**

Assume α ∉ Π(α) but Φ α Ω = Λ α Ω. Then α = β ⊕ γ for some β, γ :: ≀.

```
β ⊕ γ = (∮ (λτ. β) γ)(τ)
```

The forcing event (τ) at the outermost level means β ⊕ γ is a forced computation, not a functor application. Φ α Ω = Λ α Ω requires α to reduce to a prime functor acting on α — a value in Π(α). Forced computations cannot reduce to functor applications. ↯

∴ Φ α Ω = Λ α Ω iff α ∊ Π(α). Q.E.D.

## 6. Natural Numbers as Derived Shapes

The natural numbers are not primary objects in this system — they are a particular *shape* that falls out of the topology. The Peano structure specifies what numberness looks like, not what values numbers have.

**Peano Arithmetic:**

```
zero = ⊙(τ)       -- the shape of a ground: not in Π(⊙(τ))
succ = ∂          -- the shape of succession: ∂ ⊙(τ), ∂² ⊙(τ), ...
plus = ⊕          -- the shape of composition: superposition of waves
```

The Peano axioms follow directly from the topology of Π(⊙(τ)) and ⊕:

- zero (⊙(τ)) is not a successor — ⊙(τ) ∉ Π(⊙(τ)) by definition
- succ is injective — ∂^i ⊙(τ) ≠ ∂^j ⊙(τ) for i ≠ j
- Induction follows from the enumerable correspondence Π(⊙(τ)) ~ ℕ

Any concrete type that fits these shapes *is* a natural number system. The axioms are type constraints, not postulates. From this shape, the full classical number hierarchy is constructible via ⊕-based composition.

**Corollary:**

Let primes P be ordered as (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, ...)

```
Correspondence:
Π(⊙(τ)): 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  ...   (ordinal indices)
P:        2  3  5  7 11 13 17 19  ...
```

ℕ is derivable from Π(⊙(τ)) via ⊕:

```
For every n ∊ ℕ:
  n = p_1^a · p_2^b · ...                  -- prime decomposition
 <=>
  ζ = π_(i_1)^a ⊕ π_(i_2)^b ⊕ ...        -- prime radiant representation
  where i_k is the ordinal index of p_k in P
    and π_(i_k) = ∂^(i_k) ⊙(τ) ∊ Π(⊙(τ))

For prime n:     ζ ∊ Π(⊙(τ))              -- primary shapes
For composite n: ζ ∉ Π(⊙(τ))              -- derived via ⊕
```

∴ In Prime Radiant, primes are primary shapes and natural numbers are derived — inverting the classical foundation. The Riemann Hypothesis is then a topological theorem rather than an analytic one: Φ π Ω = Λ π Ω characterizes exactly the boundary between primary and derived shapes.

## 7. Symmetry Operators and Logic Systems

```
ι_1 = { ∂ | ∀α. ∂α = α }
ι_2 = { ∂ | ∀α. ∂^2 α = α }
...
ι_n = { ∂ | ∀α. ∂^n α = α }
```

Each ι_n characterizes a ∂ of period n, corresponding to the 2n-th roots of unity:

```
ι_n  <->  { e^(i t π/n) | t ∊ [0, 2n) }   -- orbit of size 2n
```

A logic system ι_n is *stable* if it admits orthogonal phase pairs — separated by exactly 90°. This holds iff n is a power of 2. The stable systems correspond exactly to the Cayley-Dickson algebras:

```
ι_1   -- 2  phases  -- ℝ  -- binary logic
ι_2   -- 4  phases  -- ℂ  -- Phase Logic (Lift / Falsify / Mirror / Commit)
ι_4   -- 8  phases  -- ℍ  -- quaternionic reasoning
ι_8   -- 16 phases  -- 𝕆  -- octonionic reasoning
ι_16  -- 32 phases  -- 𝕊  -- sedenions, adjunction fully breaks
```

The minimality of Phase Logic's four phases is not a design choice but a topological theorem: ι_2 is the smallest stable system admitting both non-trivial negation (∂²) and non-trivial inhabitation (∂³) before closure. Phase Logic was derived independently without reference to Prime Radiant, serving as structural witness that ι_2 emerges from the topology rather than from the choice of formalism.

The non-stable systems ι_n (n not a power of 2) correspond to branching logics — transition states between stable levels — governed by a branching factor κ = n. The full tower is indexed by κ :: ≀, the radiant numbers, which are strictly denser than the surreals:

```
ℝ ⊂ 𝕊 ⊂ ≀
```

The branching factor κ is the curvature of the reasoning path. The adjunction error Φ α Ω is the holonomy — the rotation accumulated by traversing a reasoning cycle. Together they define the local geometry of inference within the global topology of the system.

## 8. Foundational Remarks

Prime Radiant does not claim to prove the Riemann Hypothesis within ZFC. What it demonstrates is that ZFC is not the only sound foundation for mathematics.

In ZFC, primes are derived objects — emergent properties of the natural numbers. The difficulty of RH in that setting may reflect this choice of foundation as much as any deep property of primes themselves.

Prime Radiant inverts this: primes are primary topological shapes in span(∂), natural numbers are derived via ⊕, and RH becomes a structural consequence of the definitions rather than an analytic conjecture.

This places Prime Radiant alongside other alternative foundations — dependent type theory, topos theory, homotopy type theory — each of which is internally sound but carves mathematics differently. The existence of a foundation in which RH is structurally trivial is itself a meaningful result: it suggests the hardness of RH is at least partly a foundational artifact.

More broadly, Prime Radiant proposes that reasoning itself has a topology — a shape that is preserved under deformation, independent of the values that flow through it. The Cayley-Dickson tower, the natural numbers, the logic systems, and the geometry of inference are all instantiations of this topology at different levels of the radiant index κ :: ≀.
