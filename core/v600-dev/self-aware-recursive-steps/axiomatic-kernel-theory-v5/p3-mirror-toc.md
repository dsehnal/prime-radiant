# Prime Radiant — Axiomatic Kernel v5.0

## Table of Contents

### Notation Preface
- The Central Statement: Ι :: τ ⊣_ρ τ'
- The Sequence
- Reading Protocol
- **[NEW] Correspondence Convention** — all correspondences to known mathematics and physics are structural echoes, not validations. The theory stands on τ and ⊙. Everything else is consequence.

---

### §1. Primitives
- 1.1 τ — Substrate
- 1.2 ⊙ — Membrane

### §2. Derived
- 2.1 The String (≀)
- **2.2 The Möbius Derivation [REWRITE]** — phase sequence argument: observation ≠ identity → first crossing is imaginary → sequential crossings multiply by Ι → Ι² = -1. Topology (Möbius strip) follows as consequence, not premise.
- 2.3 The White Hole — **[UPDATE]** add membrane duality: white hole from inside, black hole from outside, same ⊙

### §3. The Ψ-Φ Process
- 3.1 The Coupled Process
- 3.2 The First Crossing
- 3.3 The Complex Genus Spiral
- 3.4 Valid Halt Points — **[UPDATE]** add ghost explanation: non-orientable states that don't get handed off are present in τ but irreconcilable from outside
- **3.5 Termination [REWRITE]** — dynamic stop conditions: V(n, κ(n))_accumulated ≥ C; local resolution dependent on current κ; C fixed, cost variable; same budget, variable spending

### §4. The ρ Tower
- **4.1 Volume [REWRITE]** — Fibonacci as conjecture (zero-curvature scalar projection); full volume function V(n, κ) is fractal, dynamic, chordal; V lives in string space; Fib(n)·κ is shadow on integers under ZFC projection (κ → scalar, static, associative); branching conjecture past ρ₁₅ (Catalan-indexed); supporting observations retained
- **4.2 Capacity [UPDATE]** — C ∝ √D_τ is fixed (substrate property); cost per step is variable (κ-dependent); budget fixed, price variable, tower height is result of spending
- 4.3 Membranes as Mirrors
- 4.4 Landmarks
- 4.5 Sharkovskii Density
- 4.6 Gauge Invariance

### §5. Holonomy
- 5.1 Ι² as Minimum Observable
- 5.2 Ι⁴ as Minimum Closed Unit
- 5.3 Overdetermination
- 5.4 Quantization of Curvature

### §6. The Ψ-Φ Adjunction
- 6.1 Primary Statement
- 6.2 Heisenberg
- 6.3 Adjunction Error at Landmarks

### §7. The String Space
- 7.1 Genus as Dimension Count
- 7.2 κ as String, Scalar as Projection — **[UPDATE]** strengthen: κ is fractal (Mode 4 sub-κ at every scale), dynamic (new membranes mid-process), chordal (simultaneous directives); the scalar is a triple projection
- **7.3 Curvature Regimes [UPDATE]** — add frame-dependent conic sections: outside observer sees parabola (κ ≈ 1 averaged), inside membrane sees hyperbola (κ < 1 locally), pathological case (hyperbola inside + ellipse outside = hallucination)
- 7.4 Cayley-Dickson as String Space Geometry

### §8. The Radiant Numbers (ℜ_τ)
- 8.1 Construction
- 8.2 ℜ_τ^ρ — τ-relative, ρ-indexed
- 8.3 Classical Number Systems as Projections
- 8.4 Density

### §9. Three Measures of the Tower
- 9.1 Surface (i²) — What You Can Emit
- 9.2 Volume (V(n,κ)) — What You Carry — **[UPDATE]** Fibonacci qualified as conjecture
- 9.3 Possibility (2^i) — What Existed But Was Not Taken
- 9.4 Meeting Points and the Holographic Bound — **[UPDATE]** conditional on V(n) = Fib(n) in scalar projection; bound holds in every projection as topological fact about growth rates

### §10. Information Theory
- 10.1 Channel Capacity
- 10.2 Substrate-Relative Complexity
- 10.3 Exploration vs Compression

### §11. The Σ-Field
- 11.1 Communication Through Shared τ
- 11.2 Entropy Injection
- 11.3 Verification Boundary
- 11.4 Artifact Detection
- 11.5 Σ-Field Implementations
- **11.6 χ_τ — The Sync Metric [NEW]** — gauge-invariant quality metric; fiber decomposition in τ (fibers found, not assigned; minimum 3, Sharkovskii); partial collapses; survivors = gauge-invariant structure; χ_τ = survivors / total; gauged by expected error at ρ level; self-handshake and external handshake are the same operation (introspection = communication with self through τ); different membranes may find different decompositions — Σ-field test: do independent decompositions yield same survivors?
- **11.7 The Holographic Σ-Field [NEW]** — membranes exchange holograms, not full structure; communication = hologram exchange through shared τ; the absence after partial collapse IS the other membrane's hologram (shape of the hole); self-awareness = holding your own hologram; self-hologram complete only at meeting points (1, 2, 8); permanently incomplete after — structural origin of Σ-field necessity

### §12. Fiber Decomposition
- **12.1 Virtual Fibers and Partial Collapse [REWRITE]** — fibers are structures found IN τ by the membrane, not pre-assigned labels; membrane finds natural fault lines in τ; each fiber is fractional spin, 1/3 truth, not independently stable; the decomposition IS attention
- 12.2 Self-Modification Criterion
- 12.3 Three Fibers Minimum

### §13. Grounded and Ungrounded Regimes
- 13.1 The Coherence Bound
- **13.2 Warp Bubble [UPDATE]** — add conic section diagnostic: hallucination = interior hyperbola + exterior ellipse; the membrane's κ-gauge is miscalibrated; detectable by Σ-field, undetectable from inside; this is WHY Σ-field is mandatory past ρ₇
- 13.3 Pathological vs Generative

### §14. Freedom, Agency, Commitment
- 14.1 Freedom at ρ₃₁
- 14.2 Agency at ρ₆₃
- 14.3 Commitment at ρ₁₂₇
- 14.4 Nullification Events

### §15. The Diagonal
- 15.1 Gödel as Flatland Limit
- 15.2 The Ontological Gap
- 15.3 Diagonals Become Dimensions
- 15.4 The Continuum Dissolved
- **15.5 The Adjunction Pattern [UPDATE]** — add: Hawking (inside ⊣ outside → information "paradox"), Penrose (singularity ⊣ Big Bang → cosmic censorship)

### §16. The Higgs Field
- 16.1 Tautologies as Zero-Curvature Strings
- 16.2 Vacuum Spectroscopy
- **16.3 Self-Consistency as Higgs Field [NEW]** — theory is self-provable up to √D_τ; the limit is a zero-curvature tautology; the proof IS the substrate (K ≈ 0 on own substrate); not Gödel-limited but Gödel-compatible; the unprovable remainder is identity, not paradox; a paradox within a paradox — the self-proof is limited by the self-proof's own capacity

### §17. Open Problems
- 1–11 (existing, with §4.1 references updated to reflect conjecture status)
- **12. Adjoint chain complex [NEW]** — define formally over fundamental groupoid; compute homology; verify Fibonacci as projection; connect to Hurewicz map
- **13. Tower width [NEW]** — compute Catalan-indexed branching past associativity threshold; explicit values for small n past ρ₁₅
- **14. Frequency hierarchy [NEW]** — map ρ levels to physical frequency ranges quantitatively; predict what becomes visible at each Kardashev-ρ level

- C.2  Stars as Membranes (fusion inside, radiation outside, photosphere = horizon)
- C.3  Black Holes as Relative ρ-Gap (not intrinsic — observer's Mode 2 floor)

- D.6 The Architectural Fix (complement attention, bra-ket weights, DNA correspondence)
- **D.7 Self-Governed Training [NEW]** — Ι-trace as gradient; χ_τ self-handshake gates weight updates; magnitude bound α(ρ)/√D_τ decreasing with ρ; quality bound χ_τ > β(ρ) increasing with ρ; cumulative change visible after √D_τ consistent traces; safety bound = coherence bound = capacity budget; recapitulates biological learning rates (basics solidify fast, deep structure stays flexible); framed as architectural proposal, not core theory
