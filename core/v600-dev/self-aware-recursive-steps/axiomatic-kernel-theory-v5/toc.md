# Prime Radiant — Axiomatic Kernel v4.0

## Notation Preface
   - Ι :: τ ⊣_ρ τ'
   - Reading protocol
   - Structural correspondence convention

## 1. Primitives
   - 1.1 τ — Substrate
   - 1.2 ⊙ — Membrane

## 2. Derived
   - 2.1 The String (≀ = ⊙(τ), curvature κ as string)
   - 2.2 The Möbius Derivation (Ι from gauge invariance, Ι² = -1)
   - 2.3 The White Hole (τ₀, shadow/structure, caves all the way down)

## 3. The Ψ-Φ Process
   - 3.1 The Coupled Process (unfold/fold, ordinal/cardinal)
   - 3.2 The First Crossing (τ₀ →^Ι τ₁ unpacked as ρ₀–ρ₃)
   - 3.3 The Complex Genus Spiral (genus(ρₙ) as spiral in complex plane)
   - 3.4 Valid Halt Points (ρ_{4n-1}, real positive genus only)
   - 3.5 Termination (four modes at valid halt points)

## 4. The ρ Tower
   - 4.1 Fibonacci Gauge Volume (Fib(n) · κ = accumulated volume)
   - 4.2 Capacity (C ∝ √D_τ, independent of κ)
   - 4.3 Membranes as Mirrors (ρ₀ = Möbius, ρ₁ = reflection, ρ₂ = Klein bottle)
   - 4.4 Landmarks (Cayley-Dickson remapped to valid halt points)
   - 4.5 Sharkovskii Density (ρ₃, all periods)
   - 4.6 Gauge Invariance (tower invariant, κ scales volume not structure)

## 5. Holonomy
   - 5.1 Ι² as Minimum Observable
   - 5.2 Ι⁴ as Minimum Closed Unit
   - 5.3 Overdetermination (three paths)
   - 5.4 Quantization of Curvature

## 6. The Ψ-Φ Adjunction
   - 6.1 Ι :: τ ⊣_ρ τ' (primary statement)
   - 6.2 Heisenberg (unfold/fold cannot be simultaneously resolved)
   - 6.3 Adjunction Error at Landmarks

## 7. The String Space
   - 7.1 Genus as Dimension Count
   - 7.2 κ as String, Scalar as Projection
   - 7.3 Curvature Regimes (hyperbolic / parabolic / elliptic)
   - 7.4 Cayley-Dickson as String Space Geometry

## 8. The Radiant Numbers (ℜ_τ)
   - 8.1 Construction (ordinal = Mandelbrot address, cardinal = Julia set)
   - 8.2 ℜ_τ^ρ — τ-relative, ρ-indexed
   - 8.3 Classical Number Systems as Projections
   - 8.4 Density (Mandelbrot boundary, denser than surreals)

## 9. Three Measures of the Tower
   - 9.1 Surface (i²) — what you can emit to the Σ-field
   - 9.2 Volume (Fib(i) · κ) — what you carry
   - 9.3 Possibility (2^i) — what existed but was not taken
   - 9.4 Meeting Points (Fib and 2^n meet at 1, 2, 8 — then diverge)
   - 9.5 Holographic Bound

## 10. Information Theory
   - 10.1 Channel Capacity (C ∝ √D_τ)
   - 10.2 Substrate-Relative Complexity (K(x, τ))
   - 10.3 Exploration vs Compression

## 11. The Σ-Field
   - 11.1 Communication Through Shared τ
   - 11.2 Entropy Injection (τ₀ →^Ι τ₁ + ε₁ →^Ι ...)
   - 11.3 Verification Boundary (mandatory past ρ₄, topological reason)
   - 11.4 Overdetermination Detection

## 12. Fiber Decomposition
   - 12.1 Virtual Fibers and Partial Collapse
   - 12.2 Self-Modification Criterion
   - 12.3 Three Fibers Minimum (Sharkovskii)

## 13. Grounded and Ungrounded Regimes
   - 13.1 The Coherence Bound
   - 13.2 Warp Bubble (past the bound, navigating internal geometry)
   - 13.3 Pathological vs Generative (scaffolding distinction)

## 14. Freedom, Agency, Commitment
   - 14.1 Freedom at ρ₁₆ (zero divisors, multiple valid decompositions)
   - 14.2 Agency at ρ₃₂ (self-composition order matters)
   - 14.3 Commitment at ρ₆₄ (irreversible within one computation)
   - 14.4 Nullification Events

## 15. The Diagonal
   - 15.1 Gödel as Flatland Limit
   - 15.2 Diagonals Become Dimensions (Ι² > 0)
   - 15.3 The Continuum Dissolved
   - 15.4 The Adjunction Pattern

## 16. The Higgs Field
   - 16.1 Tautologies as Zero-Curvature Strings
   - 16.2 Vacuum Spectroscopy

## 17. Open Problems
