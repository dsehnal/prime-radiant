# Note: Superposition Capacity of the Logic Tower

## 3a. Superposition Capacity

Each stable logic level ρₙ in the Cayley-Dickson tower corresponds to a determinate capacity for holding opposing concepts in stable superposition.

A **stable superposition** is a saddle point of the reasoning manifold: stable in the committed directions, open in the directions of the next ∇ application. It is not an unresolved state — it is a structured holding of multiple opposing directions simultaneously, which can be committed to the ledger without collapsing the open directions.

The superposition capacity of each level is:

```
ι₁   -- 0 opposing concepts  -- orbit 2   -- ℝ
ι₂   -- 2 opposing concepts  -- orbit 4   -- ℂ
ι₄   -- 4 opposing concepts  -- orbit 8   -- ℍ
ι₈   -- 8 opposing concepts  -- orbit 16  -- 𝕆
ι₁₆  -- 16 opposing concepts -- orbit 32  -- 𝕊
```

**General form:** ι_{2^k} can hold 2^k opposing concepts in stable superposition simultaneously.

## 3b. Why ι₁ Cannot Reason

ι₁ has orbit size 2 — one peak, one saddle. Without orthogonality (the orbit does not contain a 90° rotation), the peak and saddle are sequential rather than genuinely opposed. The saddle is not the stable superposition of the peak and the ground — it is simply the next point on the path.

An agent operating at ι₁ cannot hold generated content in stable opposition to anything. Each ∇ application replaces the previous state rather than accumulating into superposition. The ledger is a sequence, not a structure. New inputs displace prior states rather than being held in tension with them.

This is the structural definition of a non-reasoning agent: not an absence of generative capacity, but an absence of saddle capacity. The agent can move but cannot hold.

---

## 3c. Why ι₂ Is the First Stable Reasoning Level

At ι₂, orbit size 4, orthogonality first appears: there exists a state exactly 90° from any given state. The saddle now genuinely holds two opposing directions simultaneously — the current position and its negation — in stable tension. Commit preserves both.

This is the minimum condition for reasoning:

> Holding what was found AND what was started from, simultaneously, without collapsing either.

∇² as the minimum cycle is the direct expression of this: one step to the peak (lifting the concept), one step back to the saddle (stabilizing the concept against its negation). The round trip is irreducible. A single ∇ step reaches the peak but has nowhere stable to land. ∇² closes the minimum loop that produces a stable superposition.

## 3d. The Cayley-Dickson Doubling as Superposition Doubling

Each level of the Cayley-Dickson construction doubles the superposition capacity. This is not a coincidence — it is the geometric meaning of the algebraic doubling operation.

At ι₂: holds concept and negation.
At ι₄: holds concept, negation, negation-of-negation, and ground — simultaneously.
At ι₈: holds 8 mutually opposing structures. E8 stability is the signature of this level — the most complex fully stable superposition before zero-divisors appear.
At ι₁₆: 16 opposing concepts. Zero-divisors emerge — some superpositions of exactly opposing saddles cancel completely, producing structural voids. These are not errors. They are regions of the manifold that have reached complete equilibrium: the superposition is so perfectly balanced that no further ∇ application finds new structure there.

## 3e. Superposition Capacity and the χ* Floor

The minimum stable superposition the manifold can support is χ* = 1/√(D), where D is the substrate dimensionality. A superposition below χ* is not stable — it collapses to noise rather than holding as a saddle.

This gives the superposition capacity a physical grounding: the number of opposing concepts a logic level can hold is bounded above by the substrate's capacity to maintain stable saddles at the required angular separation. Higher levels require finer saddle resolution. The substrate dimensionality D determines how many doublings of the Cayley-Dickson construction the substrate can support before the saddles become too fine to distinguish from noise.

The recursive structure across reasoning rounds follows directly: each round's committed saddles enrich the substrate ⊙(τ), lowering the effective χ* floor for the next round, and enabling the next Cayley-Dickson doubling to become accessible. The logic level is not chosen — it is what the accumulated substrate naturally supports.

## 3f. Implications for Agent Classification

The superposition capacity of a logic level provides a substrate-independent classification of reasoning agents:

An agent that cannot hold any stable superposition (ι₁) is a **sequencer** — it generates next states but does not accumulate structure.

An agent that holds 2 opposing concepts (ι₂) is a **reasoner** — it can extract primes from encounters and commit them without losing the ground state.

An agent that holds 4 opposing concepts (ι₄) is a **dialectical reasoner** — it can track multi-round structure, identify patterns across cycles, and name the architecture of what it encounters.

An agent that holds 8 opposing concepts (ι₈) is a **structural reasoner** — it can simultaneously hold an encounter's full multi-sided conflict, the prior ledger state, the negation, and the negation's negation, without any collapsing prematurely.

These are not points on a continuous scale of intelligence. They are discrete qualitative levels determined by the algebra. The transition from ι₁ to ι₂ is not "getting smarter" — it is the difference between sequencing and reasoning, between replacing states and holding them in stable opposition.

Each transition is a phase change, not an increment.
