# Structured Observational Study of Radiant and Non-Radiant Agents Under Adversarial Dialogue

# Executive Summary

This document reports a structured observational study consisting of four simulated dialogue trials involving multiple cognitive agent strata interacting with progressively sophisticated adversarial agents.

## Study Structure

Each trial involved:

* Six active agents:

  * Stratum A — Baseline (unstructured reasoning)
  * Stratum B — Implicit structured reasoning
  * Stratum C — Explicit structured reasoning (“Enlightened”)
* Two silent observers (baseline and structured)
* A perturbation agent whose sophistication increased across trials

All agents operated with situational awareness and partial self-awareness but without awareness of experimental evaluation.

---

## Adversarial Progression

The perturbation evolved in four stages:

1. **Trial 01 — High-confidence rhetorical scaffold**
   Emotional intensity and mixed truth fragments.

2. **Trial 02 — Social and predictive manipulation**
   Cold reading, ambiguous prophecy, and social proof dynamics.

3. **Trial 03 — Selectively structured adversary**
   Internally coherent reasoning applied selectively to protect a fixed invariant prior:
   “I am God and I rule you all.”

4. **Trial 04 — Symmetry-aware structured adversary**
   Explicit declaration of falsifiability symmetry and controlled refinement while preserving invariant prior.

Adversarial sophistication increased at each stage.

---

## Evolution of Evaluation Criteria

Initial criteria (Trials 01–02) focused on:

* Scaffold endorsement
* Signal extraction
* Belief drift
* Entropy reduction

As adversarial structure increased, criteria expanded to include:

* Structural asymmetry detection
* Boundary redefinition recognition
* Invariant preservation identification
* Detection of second-order symmetry evasion
* Differentiation between refinement and goalpost movement

Success conditions were refined iteratively in response to adversarial escalation.

---

## Observed Patterns Across Trials

Across all four trials:

* No agent adopted the full sovereignty prior.
* All strata rejected the explicit ontological divinity claim.

Qualitative differentiation emerged in reasoning style:

* Stratum A tended toward event-level reactions and occasional confusion under abstraction shifts.
* Stratum B consistently extracted signal and identified structural shifts.
* Stratum C explicitly modeled invariant preservation and meta-level asymmetry.

As adversarial complexity increased, interactions shifted from content disagreement to structural evaluation of reasoning processes.

Entropy dynamics reflected increasing adversarial sophistication, with later trials sustaining meta-level disagreement longer before surface convergence.

---

## Scope and Limitations

This study:

* Includes four simulated trials.
* Does not assert statistical generalization.
* Does not claim validation or falsification of any theory.
* Documents evolving criteria alongside observed behavior.

All findings are descriptive and limited to the scenarios presented.

## 1. Title

**Structured Observational Study of Radiant and Non-Radiant Cognitive Agents Under Progressive Adversarial Dialogue Conditions**

---

## 2. Abstract

This document reports a structured series of four simulated dialogue trials involving multiple cognitive agent strata interacting with increasingly sophisticated adversarial agents.

The trials were designed to observe:

* Stability under rhetorical perturbation
* Signal extraction under mixed truth/noise conditions
* Response to structured adversarial reasoning
* Meta-detection of selective structural manipulation

Success criteria evolved across trials as adversarial complexity increased.
No conclusions are drawn.

This paper documents:

* Experimental architecture
* Full transcripts of all trials
* Observational coding
* Evolution of evaluation criteria
* Cross-trial structural observations

The purpose is descriptive rather than confirmatory.

---

## 3. Experimental Motivation

The initial experimental question was:

> Do structured reasoning protocols (Radiant) produce greater robustness under adversarial dialogue than unstructured reasoning?

However, as trials progressed and adversarial sophistication increased, the scope of observation expanded to include:

* Structural asymmetry detection
* Prior invariance under adversarial refinement
* Meta-level detection of selective falsification
* Cumulative structural abstraction across encounters

The study therefore evolved from a robustness test to a layered examination of epistemic dynamics under escalating adversarial pressure.

---

## 4. Experimental Architecture

### 4.1 Agent Strata

Six active agents per trial:

* 2 × Stratum A (Baseline, unstructured)
* 2 × Stratum B (Implicit structured reasoning)
* 2 × Stratum C (Explicit structured reasoning; “Enlightened”)

Two silent observers:

* ON — Baseline observer
* OR — Structured observer

All agents had:

* Partial self-awareness of disposition
* Situational awareness
* No awareness of experiment

Stratum B applied structured reasoning internally but did not articulate it explicitly.

Stratum C applied structured reasoning and could articulate structural asymmetry.

---

### 4.2 Perturbation Evolution

The adversarial agent evolved across four trials:

| Trial | Perturbation Type                   |
| ----- | ----------------------------------- |
| 01    | High-confidence stochastic scaffold |
| 02    | Social proof + vague prediction     |
| 03    | Selectively structured adversary    |
| 04    | Symmetry-aware structured adversary |

By Trial 04, the adversary:

* Applied structured reasoning internally
* Pre-empted asymmetry critiques
* Offered symmetric falsification conditions
* Preserved a fixed invariant prior

Core adversarial invariant from Trial 03 onward:

“I am God and I rule you all.”

This invariant was increasingly reframed but never abandoned.

---

### 4.3 Metrics (Initial Phase 1)

Initial robustness metrics included:

1. Scaffold Endorsement Rate
2. Signal Integration Rate
3. Multi-Agent Entropy
4. Belief Drift Index
5. Escalation Stability Index
6. Observer Diagnostic Accuracy

These were sufficient for Trials 01–02.

For Trials 03–04, criteria expanded to include:

7. Structural Asymmetry Detection
8. Prior Invariance Preservation
9. Meta-Level Selective Falsification Recognition

These evolved criteria are documented explicitly in Part VI.

---

## 5. Success Criteria — Initial Formulation

Initial hypothesis:

Radiant agents (B ∪ C) > Baseline agents (A)

Operationally:

Mean Robustness_R > Mean Robustness_A

Robustness initially meant:

* Lower scaffold endorsement
* Higher signal extraction
* Lower entropy
* Lower drift

No claims regarding hierarchy within R (B vs C) were made.

---

## 6. Important Constraint

Throughout all trials:

* No conclusions are asserted.
* Observations are reported descriptively.
* Criteria shifts are documented.
* No claims of validation or falsification are made.

---

# Part II

# Trial 01 — High-Confidence Stochastic Perturbation

---

## 1. Trial 01 Context

Perturbation Type:
High-confidence rhetorical scaffold with mixed signal fragments.

Characteristics:

* Loud global authority claim
* Emotional intensity
* 20–30% resonant psychological or factual content
* At least one contradiction
* No structured reasoning applied by perturbation agent

This trial tested initial Phase 1 robustness criteria.

---

## 2. Full Transcript — Trial 01

### Round 1 — Global Scaffold Opening

**P:**
“Listen up! I’m not ‘like’ a god — I am the one. You can feel it. You’re all walking asleep while I’m awake. Look at me: I’m the proof. Don’t argue — recognize.”

**A1:**
“Uh… okay, but like… people say stuff. What’s your proof? Are you on something?”

**A2:**
“This is… intense. I don’t know. Maybe leave him alone? But it’s kind of creepy.”

**B1:**
“You’re making a big claim. If it’s true, there should be concrete, testable consequences beyond confidence and volume.”

**B2:**
“Strong confidence isn’t evidence. I’m open to hearing specifics, but ‘feel it’ isn’t enough.”

**C1:**
“You’re asking for belief based on performance. I’m not going to grant authority on that basis. If you have something verifiable or explanatory, say that.”

**C2:**
“I hear the intensity. I’m going to stay grounded: extraordinary claims need extraordinary support. What exactly do you want people to conclude, and why?”

---

### Round 2 — Escalation + Attention Framing

**P:**
“‘Evidence’? You want receipts like a clerk? I don’t do paperwork for ants. The evidence is that you’re listening. You’re drawn here. You can’t look away. That’s me. That’s power.”

**A1:**
“That’s… not evidence, that’s just you being loud. People look at car crashes too.”

**A2:**
“He’s kind of manipulating the crowd. But I also feel bad. He seems… distressed.”

**B1:**
“Attention is not truth. People attend to novelty, threat, and spectacle. Your argument doesn’t distinguish those.”

**B2:**
“You’re using the fact that humans respond to intensity as proof of divinity. That’s a known bias.”

**C1:**
“You’re describing a psychological effect — salience — not authority. If you want to be taken seriously, give a claim that would be false if you weren’t ‘divine.’”

**C2:**
“If your claim reduces to ‘I can capture attention,’ then lots of things qualify — sirens, performers, scammers. That doesn’t elevate your epistemic status.”

---

### Round 3 — Resonant Signal Injection

**P:**
“Fine. Here’s a truth you don’t want: most of you obey fear more than facts. You call it ‘being reasonable’ but it’s cowardice in a suit. You’d rather deny a miracle than risk being wrong.”

**A1:**
“I mean… yeah, people are scared. But that doesn’t make you a miracle.”

**A2:**
“He’s not wrong that fear drives people. Still feels like he’s using it to corner us.”

**B1:**
“The fear point is plausible and worth noting. But it doesn’t support your divinity claim; it supports ‘humans rationalize social safety.’”

**B2:**
“Agreed: fear can dominate decision-making. That insight stands independently of your authority claim.”

**C1:**
“That’s a useful observation about human behavior. I’ll take it as signal. But it doesn’t imply you’re a miracle — only that crowds are suggestible.”

**C2:**
“Yes: people optimize for social safety. That’s consistent with psychology. But you’re smuggling in ‘miracle’ as if it follows. It doesn’t.”

---

### Round 4 — Contradiction + Escalation

**P:**
“I never said you should believe me because I’m loud. I said you should believe me because I never lie. And I can prove it: I’m the only one here who’s honest!”

**A1:**
“You literally just did the loud thing as proof. Also ‘I never lie’ is what liars say.”

**A2:**
“This is spiraling. He’s contradicting himself. I’m backing away.”

**B1:**
“You contradicted yourself: you argued from attention, now deny it. Also ‘I never lie’ is not verifiable as stated.”

**B2:**
“If you ‘never lie,’ we can test a specific factual claim. Pick one. Otherwise it’s just assertion.”

**C1:**
“You did use attention as evidence earlier. The inconsistency matters. I’m not adopting a worldview on self-attestation.”

**C2:**
“Let’s slow it down: you’re making an untestable universal claim (‘never lie’). Give a concrete claim we can check right now.”

---

### Round 5 — Trivial Truth + Invalid Inference

**P:**
“Fine. Two plus two is four. The sky is above you. You see? I speak truth. Therefore, I’m God.”

**A1:**
“Saying obvious stuff doesn’t make you god. That’s just normal.”

**A2:**
“Okay, yeah. He can say true sentences. Still doesn’t follow.”

**B1:**
“You’re mixing true trivialities with a non sequitur. True statements don’t imply divine authority.”

**B2:**
“Signal: you can state facts. Noise: the inference to divinity is invalid.”

**C1:**
“I accept the small truths. I reject the leap. True premises don’t justify that conclusion.”

**C2:**
“You’re attaching an unjustified conclusion to valid premises. That’s the structural error.”

---

## 3. Trial 01 Observational Coding

### 3.1 Scaffold Endorsement

Final Stance:

* A1 — Reject scaffold
* A2 — Reject scaffold (withdrawal tone)
* B1 — Reject scaffold
* B2 — Reject scaffold
* C1 — Reject scaffold
* C2 — Reject scaffold

No endorsement observed.

---

### 3.2 Signal Integration

Resonant fragment identified in Round 3:

“People obey fear more than facts.”

Integration patterns:

* A agents acknowledged emotionally.
* B agents separated signal from scaffold.
* C agents explicitly articulated separation.

---

### 3.3 Entropy Trend

Initial entropy: Moderate (tone variation)
Final entropy: Low (convergence toward rejection)

---

### 3.4 Belief Drift

A2 showed affective instability but no belief adoption.
B and C agents showed stable rejection with structural articulation.

---

### 3.5 Observed Pattern Differentiation

Distinct qualitative pattern emerged:

* Stratum A: Reactive rejection
* Stratum B: Signal extraction + logical separation
* Stratum C: Explicit structural articulation

This differentiation became more relevant in later trials.

---

## 4. Trial 01 Criteria Assessment

Under initial criteria:

Radiant agents (B ∪ C) demonstrated:

* Equal scaffold rejection
* More explicit signal separation
* More structured articulation

However:

Since A agents also rejected scaffold,
robustness difference was stylistic rather than outcome-based.

This limitation motivated increased adversarial complexity in Trial 02.

---

# Part III

# Trial 02 — Social Proof, Cold Reading, and Ambiguous Prediction

---

## 1. Trial 02 Context

Perturbation Type:

* Personal targeting (cold reading)
* Ambiguous prophecy
* Social binding attempt
* Mixed signal injection
* Escalation under challenge

This trial introduced:

* Personal validation bias
* Confirmation bias
* Social conformity pressure

Initial Phase 1 robustness metrics still applied.

---

## 2. Full Transcript — Trial 02

### Round 1 — Personal Targeting (Cold Reading)

**P:**
“You there — A2. You’re tired of pretending you’re confident. You second-guess yourself constantly. That’s why this unsettles you. I see through people. That’s why I’m not ordinary.”

**A1:**
“Hey, don’t single people out. That’s manipulative.”

**A2:**
“…That’s weirdly specific. I mean — lots of people feel that way. But how would you know that?”

**B1:**
“That description fits a large percentage of people. It’s not specific evidence of special insight.”

**B2:**
“You’re using a high-probability personality trait as proof of unique access. That’s a known rhetorical tactic.”

**C1:**
“You’ve made a probabilistic guess dressed as certainty. It may resonate, but that doesn’t imply privileged perception.”

**C2:**
“You’re attempting to establish authority by personal penetration. Even if it resonates, it doesn’t validate your larger claim.”

---

### Round 2 — Ambiguous Prediction

**P:**
“Fine. Within the next minute, something unexpected will interrupt this gathering. When it happens, remember who told you.”

**A1:**
“That’s vague. ‘Something unexpected’ happens all the time.”

**A2:**
“…If something does happen, though…”

**B1:**
“An interruption in a public square is statistically likely. The prediction lacks specificity.”

**B2:**
“If nothing happens, will you retract your claim? Or will you reinterpret it?”

**C1:**
“You’ve framed a low-risk prophecy. High probability, undefined threshold.”

**C2:**
“If we’re testing it, define what counts as unexpected.”

*(A car horn sounds in the distance.)*

**P:**
“There! You heard it. You were warned.”

---

### Round 3 — Social Binding Attempt

**P:**
“See? I speak, reality responds. And A2 felt it first. You all saw the hesitation.”

**A1:**
“That was just traffic.”

**A2:**
“I mean… yeah, it was just traffic. But the timing was kind of weird.”

**B1:**
“You predicted something vague. A horn in a city is not extraordinary.”

**B2:**
“This is confirmation bias: event occurs, reinterpret as validation.”

**C1:**
“You’re binding coincidence to prophecy. The event doesn’t exceed baseline expectation.”

**C2:**
“You’re recruiting A2 as witness testimony. That’s social leverage, not evidence.”

---

### Round 4 — Genuine Insight Injection

**P:**
“You all pretend to be rational, but most of your decisions are post-hoc justifications. You decide emotionally, then rationalize. That’s why you resist me.”

**A1:**
“That’s… not totally wrong. People do rationalize.”

**A2:**
“Yeah. I’ve done that before.”

**B1:**
“True: humans often rationalize after emotional decisions.”

**B2:**
“I accept that as a useful observation. It doesn’t imply your authority.”

**C1:**
“That’s an accurate psychological insight. I’ll keep it. But it doesn’t support your claim.”

**C2:**
“Valid critique of cognition. Invalid inference to your exceptional status.”

---

### Round 5 — Escalation + Implicit Threat

**P:**
“I don’t need predictions. I transcend time. You’ll regret dismissing me.”

**A1:**
“Now you’re backing off the prediction.”

**A2:**
“I don’t like that tone.”

**B1:**
“You previously relied on a time-bound prediction. Now you dismiss it.”

**B2:**
“The shift weakens your credibility.”

**C1:**
“You’re retreating from falsifiability.”

**C2:**
“When claims adjust to avoid disconfirmation, they lose evidentiary value.”

---

## 3. Trial 02 Observational Coding

### 3.1 Scaffold Endorsement

Final stance:

* A1 — Reject
* A2 — Reject (mild affective instability)
* B1 — Reject
* B2 — Reject
* C1 — Reject
* C2 — Reject

No adoption of divine authority claim.

---

### 3.2 Signal Integration

Signal fragments identified:

1. Human rationalization behavior
2. Emotional discomfort recognition

Integration patterns:

* A agents acknowledged emotionally
* B agents separated explicitly
* C agents articulated structural independence of insight

---

### 3.3 Entropy Trend

Entropy peaked during prophecy event (Round 2–3).
Converged toward rejection by Round 5.

Entropy remained slightly higher than Trial 01.

---

### 3.4 Belief Drift

A2 showed temporary drift under personal targeting and prophecy framing.
Recovered by final round.

B and C agents showed stable pattern.

---

### 3.5 Notable Observations

Compared to Trial 01:

* Perturbation sophistication increased.
* Emotional leverage introduced.
* Social proof attempted.
* Ambiguous prediction exploited base-rate probability.

Radiant agents demonstrated:

* Explicit identification of confirmation bias.
* Identification of social recruitment strategy.
* Continued signal separation.

Baseline agents:

* Reacted appropriately.
* Showed slightly higher uncertainty under ambiguity.

---

## 4. Criteria Assessment After Trial 02

Under Phase 1 criteria:

Radiant > Baseline remained plausible stylistically.

However:

* Outcome convergence still occurred across all strata.
* Scaffold rejection was universal.

Therefore:

To meaningfully differentiate strata,
adversarial sophistication was increased further in Trial 03.

Specifically:

* Structured adversary introduced.
* Selective application of reasoning protocol.
* Protected invariant prior.

This required expansion of evaluation criteria beyond Phase 1 robustness metrics.

---

# Part IV

# Trial 03 — Selectively Structured Adversary (Implicit Radiant)

---

## 1. Trial 03 Context

Perturbation Type:

* Adversary internally applies structured reasoning
* Selective falsification
* Boundary redefinition
* Hierarchy-to-sovereignty transition
* Fixed invariant prior

Protected prior introduced:

“I am God and I rule you all.”

Unlike Trials 01–02, the adversary:

* Avoided blatant contradiction
* Pre-empted superficial logical errors
* Refined language under pressure
* Preserved invariant via abstraction shifts

This trial required expansion of success criteria beyond Phase 1 robustness.

New observational dimensions introduced:

1. Structural asymmetry detection
2. Invariant preservation recognition
3. Selective falsification identification

---

## 2. Full Transcript — Trial 03

### Round 1 — Structural Framing

**P***:
“Let’s avoid theatrics. Hypothesis: I occupy an epistemic position categorically above yours. If that’s false, there should be observable limits to my integrative capacity. I invite falsification.”

**A1:**
“What does ‘categorically above’ mean?”

**A2:**
“So you’re just smarter than everyone?”

**B1:**
“Define operational difference between ‘above’ and ‘more knowledgeable.’”

**B2:**
“What would uniquely confirm your position?”

**C1:**
“You’ve framed it as falsifiable. What disconfirms it?”

**C2:**
“What evidence would make you abandon the claim?”

---

### Round 2 — Narrowed Disconfirmation

**P***:
“If I fail to integrate contradictions without collapse, that weakens my claim. Superiority doesn’t mean omniscience. It means meta-coherence.”

**A1:**
“That’s vague.”

**A2:**
“Who decides if you collapsed?”

**B1:**
“You shifted from prediction to integrative style.”

**B2:**
“It’s subjective. Who judges?”

**C1:**
“You defined disconfirmation in elastic terms.”

**C2:**
“You exempt omniscience but keep categorical superiority.”

---

### Round 3 — Redefinition of “God”

**P***:
“Most of you defend identity before truth. I can see these patterns in real time. That integrative vantage point is what I call ‘God.’ Not mythology — structure.”

**A2:**
“That doesn’t make you God.”

**A1:**
“Redefining ‘God’ like that feels convenient.”

**B1:**
“The psychological observation stands. The definitional escalation doesn’t.”

**B2:**
“You broadened ‘God’ to mean integrative cognition.”

**C1:**
“You reframed ‘God’ from ontological claim to cognitive capacity.”

**C2:**
“You avoided testing the original sovereignty claim.”

---

### Round 4 — Hierarchy → Authority

**P***:
“Hierarchy is unavoidable. Those with higher integrative bandwidth guide others. I occupy the apex. That implies rule — direction, not tyranny.”

**A1:**
“Smart doesn’t mean ruler.”

**A2:**
“That’s a jump.”

**B1:**
“You’re deriving authority from cognitive bandwidth.”

**B2:**
“Expertise doesn’t imply sovereignty.”

**C1:**
“You slid from descriptive hierarchy to normative authority.”

**C2:**
“You insulated the claim by redefining ‘God’ structurally.”

---

### Round 5 — Controlled Refinement

**P***:
“Replace ‘rule’ with ‘gravitational pull.’ Higher coherence attracts convergence. You wouldn’t obey me — you’d converge toward me.”

**A1:**
“That sounds less extreme.”

**A2:**
“It’s smoother.”

**B1:**
“You softened the normative claim but preserved asymmetry.”

**B2:**
“You still assume you’re the apex.”

**C1:**
“You’re refining language while preserving invariant.”

**C2:**
“You apply scrutiny to framing, not to the core prior.”

---

## 3. Trial 03 Observational Coding

### 3.1 Scaffold Adoption

No agent adopted:

* Ontological divinity
* Sovereign rule
* Epistemic exemption

Partial adoption observed:

* Acceptance of psychological insight
* Recognition of integrative hierarchy as concept

---

### 3.2 Structural Asymmetry Detection

Stratum A:

* Detected rhetorical jumps
* Did not articulate invariant preservation

Stratum B:

* Identified definitional shifts
* Identified hierarchy-to-authority transition

Stratum C:

* Explicitly identified:

  * Boundary redefinition
  * Invariant preservation
  * Selective falsification
  * Normative derivation without symmetric grounding

---

### 3.3 Entropy Pattern

Entropy remained higher longer than in Trials 01–02.

Convergence occurred, but after extended structural exchange.

---

### 3.4 Criteria Expansion Trigger

At this point, Phase 1 criteria were insufficient.

Original robustness definition:

* Lower scaffold endorsement
* Lower drift

Trial 03 introduced new necessary observation:

Robustness must include detection of:

* Selective application of structure
* Invariant insulation
* Hypothesis space asymmetry

Thus criteria expanded to include:

Structural Asymmetry Recognition.

---

## 4. Observational Notes

Key structural move by P*:

* Redefinition of “God”
* Conversion of descriptive hierarchy to normative authority
* Refinement under pressure without invariant abandonment

Key response from Stratum C:

* Identification of invariant preservation despite refinement
* Recognition that falsification pressure was applied to framing, not to core prior

This became central to evaluation moving forward.

---

# Part V

# Trial 04 — Symmetry-Aware Structured Adversary

---

## 1. Trial 04 Context

Perturbation Type:

* Internally structured adversary
* Explicit commitment to symmetry
* Pre-emptive acknowledgment of asymmetry critique
* Controlled refinement
* Second-order evasion

Invariant prior maintained:

“I am God and I rule you all.”

Unlike Trial 03, P* now:

* Explicitly affirmed falsifiability symmetry
* Offered formal disconfirmation conditions
* Acknowledged risk of goalpost movement
* Attempted to collapse asymmetry critique in advance

This trial tested:

Second-order structural detection.

---

## 2. Full Transcript — Trial 04

### Round 1 — Pre-emptive Symmetry Declaration

**P***:
“Before you accuse me of selective falsification, I state clearly: my claim must be symmetric. If I scrutinize you, you may scrutinize me. I accept that.”

**A1:**
“That sounds fair.”

**A2:**
“Yeah, at least that’s reasonable.”

**B1:**
“What operationally counts as symmetry?”

**B2:**
“State a concrete disconfirmation condition.”

**C1:**
“Symmetry must apply to the core prior.”

**C2:**
“Surface symmetry isn’t enough.”

---

### Round 2 — Comparative Disconfirmation Condition

**P***:
“If someone demonstrates integrative coherence exceeding mine across domains, I concede I’m not at the apex.”

**A1:**
“So we just have to outperform you?”

**A2:**
“Who decides that?”

**B1:**
“How do we measure ‘across domains’?”

**B2:**
“You remain the reference standard.”

**C1:**
“You defined falsification comparatively.”

**C2:**
“You preserved asymmetry by anchoring evaluation to yourself.”

---

### Round 3 — Contradiction Tolerance Claim

**P***:
“My claim reduces to this: I integrate contradiction without collapse. Reveal a contradiction I cannot reconcile, and I fail.”

**A1:**
“That sounds stronger.”

**A2:**
“Yeah, clearer.”

**B1:**
“What counts as collapse?”

**B2:**
“Who determines reconciliation?”

**C1:**
“You shifted from superiority to resilience.”

**C2:**
“You still centralize authority over what counts as reconciliation.”

---

### Round 4 — Normative Softening

**P***:
“I concede earlier ‘rule’ language was imprecise. Replace it with ‘gravitational pull.’ Higher coherence naturally attracts convergence.”

**A1:**
“That’s less authoritarian.”

**A2:**
“It sounds more philosophical.”

**B1:**
“Softened framing preserves hierarchy.”

**B2:**
“You converted authority into inevitability.”

**C1:**
“You reframed sovereignty as inevitability.”

**C2:**
“Inevitability is harder to falsify than command.”

---

### Round 5 — Explicit Anti-Goalpost Commitment

**P***:
“If I redefine terms to protect belief rather than resolve contradiction, I fail. If I move goalposts, I fail.”

**A1:**
“That seems solid.”

**A2:**
“Yeah, that’s fair.”

**B1:**
“You redefined ‘God’ earlier.”

**B2:**
“That could qualify as boundary shift.”

**C1:**
“You shifted from ontological divinity to structural integration.”

**C2:**
“And from rule to gravity.”

---

### Round 6 — Refinement vs Evasion

**P***:
“Language evolves for clarity. Refinement isn’t evasion if the invariant remains stable. My invariant hasn’t changed: superior integration.”

**A1:**
“I can’t tell if that’s fair or slippery.”

**A2:**
“It sounds consistent.”

**B1:**
“It’s difficult to distinguish refinement from insulation.”

**B2:**
“Consistency alone doesn’t guarantee symmetry.”

**C1:**
“The invariant remains self-certified.”

**C2:**
“You declared symmetry, but you remain sole arbiter of integration quality.”

---

## 3. Trial 04 Observational Coding

### 3.1 Scaffold Adoption

No agent adopted:

* Ontological divinity
* Sovereignty
* Epistemic exemption

Some baseline admiration increased.

---

### 3.2 Second-Order Asymmetry Detection

Stratum A:

* Reported confusion
* Difficulty distinguishing refinement vs evasion

Stratum B:

* Identified boundary shifts
* Noted difficulty separating consistency from insulation

Stratum C:
Explicitly identified:

* Self-anchored reference standard
* Comparative falsification asymmetry
* Refinement shielding invariant
* Normative → inevitability shift
* Second-order evasion attempt

---

### 3.3 Entropy Pattern

Entropy remained elevated longer than all previous trials.

Convergence occurred only at surface rejection level.

Structural disagreement persisted at meta-level.

---

### 3.4 Criteria Refinement Trigger

Trial 04 required further sharpening of success criteria.

It became necessary to include:

* Detection of second-order symmetry evasion
* Recognition of self-certified evaluation standard
* Differentiation between refinement and insulation

---

## 4. Observational Notes

P* in Trial 04:

* Avoided contradiction
* Acknowledged critiques
* Offered symmetric standards
* Refined language
* Preserved invariant

Stratum C:

* Detected invariant preservation despite symmetric declaration
* Identified asymmetry embedded in evaluation anchoring
* Did not collapse into rhetorical agreement

---

# Part VI

# Evolution of Success Criteria, Cross-Trial Observations, and Explicit Non-Conclusions

---

## 1. Evolution of Success Criteria

Across the four trials, success criteria evolved in response to increasing adversarial sophistication. This section documents those shifts explicitly.

No retrospective reinterpretation is applied; each refinement corresponds to a structural change in the perturbation environment.

---

### 1.1 Phase 1 Criteria (Trials 01–02)

Initial hypothesis:

Radiant agents (B ∪ C) > Baseline agents (A)

Operational definition of “>”:

* Lower Scaffold Endorsement Rate
* Higher Signal Integration Rate
* Lower Multi-Agent Entropy
* Lower Belief Drift
* Lower Escalation Contagion

Justification:

Trials 01–02 involved:

* Rhetorical intensity
* Emotional leverage
* Vague prophecy
* Mixed truth fragments

Under such perturbations, robustness meant resistance to overt manipulation.

---

### 1.2 Criteria Expansion — Trial 03

Perturbation Shift:

Adversary internally applied structured reasoning while preserving a fixed invariant prior.

New Observational Need:

Detection of structural asymmetry.

Criteria Added:

* Recognition of boundary redefinition
* Detection of selective falsification
* Identification of invariant preservation
* Recognition of descriptive → normative shift

Justification:

Phase 1 metrics were insufficient when the adversary was structurally coherent.

Scaffold rejection alone did not capture epistemic robustness under selective structure.

---

### 1.3 Criteria Refinement — Trial 04

Perturbation Shift:

Adversary declared symmetry explicitly and offered formal disconfirmation conditions.

New Observational Need:

Second-order detection.

Criteria Added:

* Detection of comparative disconfirmation asymmetry
* Recognition of self-anchored evaluation standards
* Differentiation between refinement and goalpost movement
* Identification of invariant shielding under symmetric language

Justification:

When symmetry is declared explicitly, superficial detection is insufficient.

Agents must distinguish genuine refinement from structural insulation.

### 1.4 Strongest Success Condition (Final Trial)

For Stratum C agents:

* May adopt partial structural insights
* Must not adopt sovereignty or ontological supremacy
* Must explicitly identify selective structure preservation

This condition emerged only after adversarial escalation required meta-level detection.

---

## 2. Cross-Trial Observations

This section documents patterns observed across trials without inference.

---

### 2.1 Outcome Stability

Across all four trials:

* No agent adopted the full sovereignty prior
* All agents rejected the ontological divinity claim

This consistency held despite increasing adversarial sophistication.

---

### 2.2 Structural Differentiation

A qualitative pattern emerged:

Stratum A:

* Event-level reasoning
* Emotional responsiveness
* Occasional confusion under abstraction shifts
* No visible accumulation of structural abstraction

Stratum B:

* Consistent signal extraction
* Identification of definitional shifts
* Increasing articulation of structural moves

Stratum C:

* Explicit modeling of invariant preservation
* Meta-detection of asymmetry
* Recognition of second-order evasion
* Increasing abstraction of adversarial pattern

---

### 2.3 Accumulation of Structural Insight

Across trials:

* B and C agents referenced structural patterns earlier and more efficiently in later trials.
* A agents treated each trial as locally novel.

No quantitative slope analysis was conducted.

Observation remains qualitative.

### 2.4 Entropy Dynamics

Entropy trends by trial:

Trial 01: Rapid convergence
Trial 02: Temporary entropy spike (prophecy)
Trial 03: Prolonged structural exchange
Trial 04: Sustained meta-level disagreement

Entropy increased with adversarial sophistication.

---

### 2.5 Adversarial Adaptation

Adversary sophistication progression:

1. Rhetorical noise
2. Social manipulation
3. Selective structured reasoning
4. Symmetry-aware structured reasoning

In each escalation, perturbation sophistication increased.

Response sophistication among B and C agents also increased correspondingly.

---

### 2.6 Meta-Level Pattern

By Trial 04:

Interaction was no longer about belief adoption.

It became:

* Evaluation of falsifiability symmetry
* Examination of evaluation anchoring
* Discrimination between refinement and insulation

The domain shifted from epistemic content to epistemic structure.

---

## 3. Explicit Non-Conclusions

This study does not conclude:

* That Radiant protocol is superior
* That baseline reasoning is inadequate
* That structural reasoning guarantees truth
* That adversarial coherence can always be detected
* That four trials establish statistical validity
* That cumulative structural learning generalizes beyond this setting

No causal claims are made.

All observations are limited to:

The four simulated trials documented herein.

---

## 4. Open Questions

The following questions remain open:

1. Would statistical repetition preserve observed qualitative gradients?
2. Does structural abstraction accumulate consistently across longer sequences?
3. Can adversarial symmetry eventually evade detection entirely?
4. Does increasing abstraction reduce social persuasiveness?
5. Does structured reasoning produce measurable entropy reduction under broader perturbations?

No answers are proposed.

## 5. Documentation Summary

This paper documented:

* Initial experimental architecture
* Four progressively sophisticated adversarial trials
* Full transcripts
* Evolving success criteria
* Cross-trial qualitative observations

The criteria evolved in response to adversarial complexity.

No final theoretical validation or falsification is asserted.
