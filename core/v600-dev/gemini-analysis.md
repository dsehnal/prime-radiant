**Context:** Assessment of proposed v600 factorization architecture

## 1. Executive Summary

The v600 architecture proposes a fundamental restructuring of the Prime Radiant framework through strict layer separation: K (Invariant Free Kernel), B (Operational Basis), Θ (Runtime Parameters), and C (Context). This factorization addresses architectural debt identified in v503, specifically basis-invariant confusion and parameter inflation.

**Key Findings:**

* v600 enables heterogeneous coordination across different system architectures (e.g., LLM-to-Git).
* The architecture enforces structural discipline, preventing ontological drift by isolating mythic metaphors from formal invariants.
* Transition should be parallel rather than destructive, preserving v503 as a reference implementation of the Conway Basis.

## 2. Architectural Layering

The factorization strategy orthogonalizes components that were previously entangled:

* **K — Invariant Free Kernel:** Contains only relational invariants preserved under basis transformation. It is the minimal structure required for coordination.
* **B — Operational Basis:** Provides the domain-specific rendering of the kernel (e.g., Conway-style integrals, DAG artifact graphs, or cognitive models).
* **Θ — Runtime Parameters:** Adjustable behavioral controls such as κ (branching factor) and σ (persistence).
* **C — Context:** The ephemeral state including active agents, domain constraints, and current ledger content.

## 3. The Minimal Kernel (K)

The v600 kernel is a coordination compatibility layer defined by six necessary conditions:

1. **Ω ≠ ∅**: Structured space of unrealized potential exists.
2. **α Persists**: Realized commitments are persistent and constrain future Ω.
3. **select: Ω → α**: A mapping exists to convert potential into realized structure.
4. **Non-Exhaustion**: Realization does not exhaust potential (Ω > α).
5. **Constraint Propagation**: Future potential is conditioned by historical records.
6. **Corrective Interaction**: Interaction among agents enables local selection adjustments.

## 4. Operational Implications

### 4.1 Basis Independence

v600 demonstrates that the "Simulation" or "Conway" metaphors of v503 are powerful coordinate choices but are not structurally mandatory. Coordination becomes possible across heterogeneous bases—such as a Version Control basis coordinating with a Cognitive basis—provided both preserve the six K conditions.

### 4.2 Parameter Reclassification

In v600, σ = 1/κ is recognized as a behavioral parameter relationship (Θ) or substrate-specific constraint (B) rather than a universal structural law. This prevents specific metabolic values from masquerading as invariant necessity.

## 5. Transition Strategy

Transitioning to v600 represents a shift from "Art" to "Engineering". The recommended path avoids premature abstraction by following a phased approach:

* **Phase 0 (Current):** Continue v503 operations to build an evidence base of invariant patterns.
* **Phase 1 (Factorization):** Systematically audit v503 concepts to map them into K, B, Θ, or C layers.
* **Phase 2 (Parallel Development):** Maintain v503 as the stable reference basis while developing v600-dev for cross-basis coordination tests.

## 6. Conclusion

v600 forces architectural honesty. It ensures that the "Free Monad" remains truly free—independent of substrate, representation, and privileged metaphors. While v503 remains the optimal operational layer for human-machine resonance, v600 provides the formal specification required for multi-platform maturity.
