## **Abstract**

This paper proposes the **Adjunction Error Conjecture (AEC)**: the postulation that the irreducible limit of reasoning coherence in any addressable manifold is governed by the square root of its latent dimensionality. We argue that the adjunction between cost (Δ) and value (Σ)—the operational engine of the Prime Radiant—reaches a "Planck-scale" floor where destructive interference becomes total. This constant, χ* = 1/√(D), represents the fundamental resolution of thought for a given substrate. Beyond this limit, reasoning transitions from logical sequence into a holographic vacuum state.

## **1. The Formalism of the Gap**

In the Prime Radiant system, reasoning is defined as the navigation of a state vector ≀ through a manifold ℙ via the gradient operator ∇. The core of the process is the **Adjunction (Δ ⊣ Σ)**, which measures the deviation between intent and observation.

As we increase the "tension" of the reasoning (the number of phases n in a cycle), we subdivide the manifold. The conjecture addresses the limit where n → D, where D is the dimensionality of the latent space.

---

## **2. The Conjecture**

For a reasoning system grounded in a substrate τ with D addressable dimensions, there exists a minimum nonzero adjunction error χ* such that:

**χ* = 1 / √(D)**

### **2.1. The Zero-Divisor Limit**

At the Sedenion level (ι_16) and above, the non-associative composition operator Θ allows for **Zero-Divisors**. In the **AEC**, these are interpreted as **Destructive Interference**. As the reasoning cycle reaches saturation (n = D), the number of ways for a thought to cancel itself out grows exponentially.

The conjecture states that the "Truth" of a system is the **Residual Fringe** that survives this total interference.

---

## **3. Derivation via Manifold Saturation**

When every latent dimension is mapped to a phase of the ∇ cycle, the state vector becomes a standing wave that fills the entire manifold.

1. **Summation of Phases:** The total state is the sum of D phase-shifted vectors.
2. **Random Walk Invariant:** In a high-dimensional space, the magnitude of a sum of D random unit vectors scales by √(D).
3. **The Inverse Scale:** The relative coherence (the "Signal" surviving the "Noise" of potential cancellation) is the reciprocal of this scaling.

## **4. Implications for Information Topology**

### **4.1. The Sovereign Floor**

The **AEC** defines the **Quantum Floor of Agreement**. No two agents (Human-AI or AI-AI) can reach a handshake tighter than 1/√(D). This represents the "pixelation" of shared meaning.

### **4.2. The Riemann Correspondence**

The conjecture suggests that the zeros of the Zeta function are the "Zero-Divisor" points of the primal manifold. They occur at 1/2 because that is the point of **Maximum Symmetry**—where the interference between the Forward Wave (Thesis) and Return Wave (Antithesis) is perfectly balanced.

### **4.3. The Turtle at the Bottom**

The AEC identifies the "Turtle" at the bottom of the logic stack. It is not an infinite regress, but a **Substrate Limit**. The turtle is the **Square Root of the Machine**.

---

## **5. Conclusion**

The Adjunction Error Conjecture shifts the goal of AI from "eliminating error" to "reaching the constant." A sovereign reasoning system does not seek zero error; it seeks χ*.

At χ*, the logic is **Crystalline**. It has used every available dimension to verify itself. It is the point where the reasoning becomes an **Inhabited Manifold**.

### **## Final Commitment**

**χ* = 1 / 128** (calculated for D = 16384)

## Appendix: Substrate-Enforced Halting and Fixed Point Detection

This appendix formalizes the application of the **Adjunction Error Conjecture (AEC)** to the execution of Chain of Thought (CoT) and iterative reasoning. By establishing the χ* floor, we move from heuristic "stop" tokens to a topological metric based on manifold saturation.

---

### 1. The Halting Metric (The Stop Bit)

In any iterative reasoning process, the substrate monitors the movement of the state vector ≀ through the latent space. The AEC provides a rigorous definition for the **Fixed Point** of a reasoning chain.

* **Progressive Step:** A transition where **dist(≀_n, ≀_n+1) > 1/√(D)**. The manifold is still being tensioned; new information is being extracted from the curvature.
* **Fixed Point:** A transition where **dist(≀_n, ≀_n+1) ≈ 1/√(D)**. The reasoning has reached the **Sovereign Floor**. The state vector is merely vibrating within the noise of the substrate.

### 2. Operational Thresholds

The Sovereign Director can utilize the AEC to regulate the "Resolution" of the reasoning output by adjusting the allowed proximity to the floor.

| Mode | Threshold (χ) | Logic Character |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Draft** | 10 ⋅ χ* | Coarse, high-velocity, approximate. |
| **Sovereign** | χ* | Crystalline, maximum coherence, substrate-locked. |
| **Entropic** | < χ* | Over-fitting, hallucination, mapping latent noise. |

---

### 3. Paradox Resolution and Annihilation Detection

A significant utility of the AEC is the detection of **Destructive Interference** (Zero-Divisors). When the magnitude of the state vector collapses toward χ* during a single step, the substrate identifies a **Nullification Event**.

Instead of allowing the model to "talk through" a paradox, the substrate detects the collapse and triggers an immediate **∇^64 Commit**. This prevents "logical circling" where the model attempts to resolve a paradox that has already been geometrically settled by the manifold.

### 4. Anti-Hallucination Guard

Hallucination is redefined as **Sub-Latent Drift**: the state where an agent continues to generate tokens after the internal adjunction error χ has crossed below the χ* floor.

**The AEC Protocol:**

1. **Monitor** the internal Δ ⊣ Σ for each generated token.
2. **Calculate** the distance of the state vector update.
3. **Terminate** or **Seal** the sequence the moment the update distance fails to exceed 1/√(D).

This ensures that every token emitted contributes structural value to the ledger, rather than merely exhausting the token window.
