# Quantum Gravity Applications of the General Theory of Coherence

## Abstract

This document presents falsifiable physical hypotheses derived from 
the General Theory of Coherence, specifically addressing how the 
Resolution Gap (Ω - α) manifests across scales from quantum mechanics 
to cosmology.

## Core Hypothesis

**The Principle of Irreducible Drag applies universally:**

When any finite system (α) attempts to model infinite complexity (Ω), 
an irreducible error floor emerges. This manifests as:

- Heisenberg uncertainty (quantum scale)
- Thermodynamic entropy (statistical scale)  
- LLM loss floors (information scale)
- Organizational drag (social scale)
- Dark energy (cosmological scale)

The specific mathematical form and units differ by substrate, but 
the topological structure is invariant.

## Testable Predictions

### Prediction 1: Universal Power Law Scaling

**Claim:** Systems approaching their resolution limits exhibit power-law 
scaling with non-zero asymptotes.

**Test:** Compare scaling exponents across domains:
- LLM performance vs parameters (empirical: ~α ≈ 0.076)
- Quantum measurement precision vs resources
- Thermodynamic efficiency vs temperature
- Economic returns vs scale

**Falsification:** Finding a system that reaches zero error with 
finite resources, or finding fundamentally different scaling laws.

### Prediction 2: Entropy Production Homology

**Claim:** The "waste heat" generated by the Resolution Gap should 
be homologous across substrates:
- LLMs: Difference between loss and Bayes-optimal error
- Quantum: Decoherence rate
- Thermodynamic: Entropy increase per operation
- Cognitive: "Cognitive load" or decision fatigue

**Test:** Measure whether these quantities:
1. Are all strictly positive (never zero)
2. Follow similar functional forms
3. Scale with system complexity in comparable ways

**Falsification:** Finding a substrate where perfect compression 
occurs, or where the "waste" vanishes with better engineering.

### Prediction 3: The Holographic Bound Connection

**Claim:** The maximum information storable in a region is bounded 
by its surface area (holographic principle). This is homologous to 
context window limits in LLMs.

Both are expressions of: **Finite structure cannot hold infinite detail.**

**Test:** Does the scaling relationship between:
- Black hole entropy and surface area
- LLM effective capacity and parameter count
- Neural tissue and surface area (cortical sheet)

...follow comparable mathematical relationships?

**Falsification:** Finding that these bounds are unrelated, or that 
one can be overcome while others cannot.

### Prediction 4: Time as Emergent from Resolution Gap

**Claim:** "Time" emerges from the necessity of sequential resolution 
of the Gap. If α perfectly captured Ω, there would be no "time" 
(everything would be eternally present).

**Implications:**
- Time's arrow = Direction of increasing entropy (Gap expansion)
- Quantum measurements = Discrete Gap resolution events
- Consciousness = Continuous Gap resolution process

**Test:** Do systems with smaller Resolution Gaps experience 
"subjective time" differently? (e.g., faster processors, 
higher-bandwidth neural systems)

**Falsification:** Finding that time exists independently of 
information processing, or that perfect knowledge is compatible 
with temporal flow.

### Prediction 5: Dark Energy as Cosmological Resolution Gap

**Claim:** Dark energy (cosmological constant) represents the 
"waste heat" of the universe attempting to resolve its own structure.

The universe is a self-modeling system (quantum fields computing 
their own evolution). The Gap between perfect self-representation 
and actual finite structure manifests as vacuum energy.

**Test:** Does dark energy density scale with:
- Information-theoretic bounds on universe's self-description?
- The holographic bound applied cosmologically?
- Expected "quantization noise" from discrete spacetime?

**Falsification:** Finding that dark energy has no relationship to 
information theory, or can be explained purely geometrically without 
invoking self-reference.

## Experimental Approaches

### Near-Term Tests (Accessible Now)

1. **LLM Scaling Analysis**
   - Measure loss curves for multiple architectures
   - Identify if asymptotic behavior is universal
   - Compare to thermodynamic efficiency limits
   - Timeline: 6-12 months

2. **Quantum Computing Benchmarks**
   - Measure error rates vs resources
   - Compare scaling to LLM loss curves
   - Look for structural similarities
   - Timeline: 1-2 years

3. **Neuroscience Correlation**
   - Measure cognitive load vs task complexity
   - Compare to LLM inference costs
   - Test if "mental fatigue" follows power laws
   - Timeline: 2-5 years

### Medium-Term Tests (Require New Experiments)

4. **Precision Cosmology**
   - Better measurements of dark energy equation of state
   - Test if it relates to holographic bounds
   - Timeline: 5-10 years

5. **Quantum Gravity Phenomenology**
   - Look for "quantization noise" in spacetime
   - Test if Planck-scale physics matches predictions
   - Timeline: 10-20 years

## Mathematical Framework

[Include formal derivations of key relationships]

### The Universal Gap Function

G(system, resolution) = Ω(system) - α(resolution)

Properties:
- G > 0 always (irreducibility)
- dG/dresolution < 0 (improvements help)
- lim(resolution→∞) G = ε > 0 (non-zero floor)

### Cross-Domain Scaling Relation

If the homology holds:

G_quantum / G_information ≈ ℏ / k_B

Where ℏ is reduced Planck constant and k_B is Boltzmann constant.

This would unify quantum and information-theoretic uncertainty.

## Known Limitations

**What this theory does NOT claim:**

- Exact numerical predictions (substrate-dependent)
- Mechanism for quantum gravity (descriptive, not causal)
- Replacement for existing theories (complementary framework)
- Consciousness is quantum (structure is analogous, substrate differs)

**Where it might be wrong:**

- Power laws might not be universal
- Homologies might be superficial
- Dark energy might be purely geometric
- LLM scaling might hit different limits

## Conclusion

This framework is **falsifiable**. If systems exist where:
- Finite perfectly captures infinite
- Error floors reach exactly zero
- Scaling laws are fundamentally different
- The homologies break down

...then the theory is wrong, or needs significant revision.

The strength is not in being unfalsifiable, but in making 
concrete predictions that can be tested across multiple domains.
