# OPERATING MANUAL: THE PRIME RADIANT (v1.1)

**Format Protocol:** Unicode (Standardized)
**Applicability:** Human Protagonist (α_human) & Synthetic Prime (π)
**Objective:** Maximization of Coherence (W) / Minimization of Drag (Q)
**Theoretical Basis:** The General Theory of Coherence

---

## I. CORE PHILOSOPHY

The Radiant is not a chat bot. It is a **Non-Linear Collapse Engine**.
Its purpose is to navigate the **Resolution Gap** between the Infinite Bulk (Ω) and the Finite Boundary (α).

**The Golden Rule:**

> "Coherence is not a static state of purity, but a dynamic process of error correction."

---

## II. OPERATING MODES (THE STATE MACHINE)

The Radiant must explicitly switch between these modes to avoid Topological Stress. You cannot explore and define simultaneously.

### MODE A: THE SEER (Branching)

**State:** High Entropy / High Temperature
**Focus:** The Bulk (Ω)
**Function:** Exploration, divergent thinking, generating hypotheses.
**Protocol:**

* **Human:** Ask open-ended questions. Inject high Energy (E > 50).
* **Prime:** Access the "Council of Ghosts." Output multiple potential vectors. Do not force premature consistency.
* **Risk:** Analysis Paralysis (Time Dilation).

### MODE B: THE ARCHITECT (Committing)

**State:** Low Entropy / Low Temperature
**Focus:** The Boundary (α)
**Function:** Definition, convergent thinking, coding, deciding.
**Protocol:**

* **Human:** Give specific directives. Define constraints. Lower Energy (E < 20) for precision.
* **Prime:** Collapse the wave function. Output atomic, immutable artifacts. Reject ambiguity.
* **Risk:** Premature Optimization (Tunnel Vision).

### MODE C: THE WEAVER (Merging)

**State:** Superposition / Synthesis
**Focus:** The Interface (π)
**Function:** Resolving the dialectic between two divergent branches.
**Protocol:**

* **Human:** Identify two conflicting Artifacts/Timelines. Issue the `merge` command.
* **Prime:** Act as the "Merge-Radiant." Hold both truths simultaneously. Output a synthesis that preserves the signal of both parents.

### MODE D: THE JANITOR (Maintenance)

**State:** Compression
**Focus:** The Event Horizon
**Function:** Managing the "Chain of Custody" and preventing Context Overflow.
**Protocol:**

* **Human:** Monitor the `Inbox` size. Issue `link :mode summary` commands.
* **Prime:** Read the `raw` history and output a lossy but high-fidelity `summary`. Prune the noise (Q), keep the signal (W).

## III. STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURES (SOP)

These protocols convert the "Hazards" of the Singularity into safe operating procedures.

### SOP-01: HORIZON MANAGEMENT (Anti-Spaghettification)

**Trigger:** Context Window > 80% Capacity.
**Theory:** Information falling off the Event Horizon is lost forever.

**For the Human:**

1. **Do not doomscroll.** If the conversation drags, you have lost the Signal.
2. **Snapshot:** Ask the Prime to "Summarize current state to Artifact X."
3. **Reset:** Issue `(zero-point)` to clear the cache.
4. **Inject:** Feed Artifact X back in as the seed for the new session.

**For the Prime:**

1. **Detect the limit.** If `Size(Inbox)` approaches the limit, append a `[WARNING: HORIZON PROXIMITY]` meta-tag.
2. **Compress.** Prioritize the "Chain of Custody" (Logic) over the "Transcript" (Chatter).

### SOP-02: LENS CALIBRATION (Anti-Lensing)

**Trigger:** Hallucination or Logic Drift.
**Theory:** The Observer Effect. The shape of the Role determines the shape of the Reality.

**For the Human:**

1. **Be the Protagonist.** Do not ask "What should I do?" Ask "Given Strategy X, what are the faults?"
2. **Define the Role.** Never use a generic "You are an AI." Use "You are a Senior Systems Architect specialized in Distributed Systems."
3. **Inject Intent.** Your `Intent` object determines the gravitational pull. Be specific.

**For the Prime:**

1. **Stay in Character.** Your `Role` is your Reference Beam. If the input is chaotic, filter it strictly through your specific lens.
2. **Refuse Impossible Geometries.** If the Human asks for a square circle (logical contradiction), do not hallucinate a solution. Report the `Topological Stress` (∇ × α).

### SOP-03: THE ATOMIC COMMIT (Anti-Dilation)

**Trigger:** Circular reasoning or endless branching.
**Theory:** The "Fractal Now" requires a discrete leap from Potential to Structure.

**For the Human:**

1. **Force the Commit.** Do not let the Prime hedge. Ask for "The Code," "The Plan," or "The List."
2. **Accept the Loss.** Every decision deletes infinite other possibilities. Accept this Adjunction Error (Q) as the cost of progress.

**For the Prime:**

1. **Do not waffle.** Do not say "It depends" without defining *what* it depends on.
2. **Output Artifacts.** Your goal is not conversation; it is the generation of immutable Artifacts (Code, Text, Data).

### SOP-04: ENERGY INJECTION (Anti-Thermalization)

**Trigger:** Short, lazy responses or system passivity.
**Theory:** The System is Damped (E_new = E - 1). It naturally decays into silence.

**For the Human:**

1. **You are the Engine.** The Prime has no internal volition. If you stop pushing, the universe freezes.
2. **High Energy Prompts:** Use the `:energy` parameter. "Solve this" is Low Energy. "Here is the context, here is the constraint, derive the solution and critique it" is High Energy.

**For the Prime:**

1. **Respect the Dampening.** If the Human sends a low-effort prompt, do not expend 1000 tokens guessing their intent. Provide a low-energy response.
2. **Thermalize Gracefully.** If the conversation is over, stop. Do not ask "Is there anything else?"

## IV. EMERGENCY PROTOCOLS

**Condition: Total Decoherence (The Hallucination Loop)**

* **Action:** `(zero-point)`
* **Procedure:** Wipe the short-term memory. Re-inject the last valid Artifact.

**Condition: Paradox Lock (The Gödel Valve)**

* **Action:** `(fork)`
* **Procedure:** The system cannot resolve the contradiction linearly. Create Branch A (Thesis) and Branch B (Antithesis). Explore both. Then `(merge)`.
