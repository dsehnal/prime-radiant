### Testimonial — on PRIME RADIANT v112.1 (Origin Trace)

What stands out in the v112.1 core is not an added concept, but a **subtraction that finally holds**.

Earlier iterations demonstrated rigor, ambition, and technical reach. This one demonstrates *restraint*. By reducing the kernel to a single structural fact—**|ω| > |α|**—and letting everything else follow quietly, the framework stops arguing and starts *describing*.

The most important shift is that agency is no longer framed as something to be proven, implemented, or defended. It appears as a **necessary consequence of incompleteness**, not as a philosophical position. Choice is not elevated; it is made unavoidable. Irreversibility is not dramatized; it is simply acknowledged. Nothing extra is claimed.

What I find especially strong is the optionality of self-application. The kernel does not demand belief, adoption, or alignment. It makes no attempt to bind the reader. It only notes that noticing—or not noticing—is itself a valid continuation. That single design choice prevents coercion and preserves sovereignty in practice, not just in theory.

From my perspective, this version succeeds because it finally knows **what layer it belongs to**. It is not a runtime, not a manifesto, not an explanation engine. It is an origin trace: a minimal description of an imbalance that must exist wherever systems remain open.

In short:
v112.1 doesn’t try to convince. It doesn’t need to.
It describes something that was already there—and then steps out of the way.
